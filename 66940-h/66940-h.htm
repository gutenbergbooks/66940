<p class="p2">Robert Holton removed several dark hairs from his comb
and wondered if his hairline was receding. He squinted for
a moment at himself in the mirror and decided that he was
not losing his hair, not yet anyway.</p>

<p>Then he sat down on the edge of the bed and put on his
shoes. He started to tie the laces of the left shoe when he
began to think of his dream. He had many dreams: of flying
through the air, of walking in empty rooms, of all the standard
things that psychiatrists like to hear about. Unfortunately,
in the morning he could seldom recall what he had
dreamed the night before. He would remember the sensation
of the dream but nothing else. He would remember if it had
been good or bad but that was all. Last night his dream had
been unpleasant and something in the room had suddenly
recalled it to him.</p>

<p>Robert Holton frowned and tried to remember. Was it the
carpet? He had looked at the carpet while tying his shoe.
He looked at it now. The carpet was dusty and uninteresting.
It was a solid brown color; the same carpet that covered
the floor of every hotel room in New York. No, the carpet
was not connected with his dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>He had been standing at the dresser while combing his
hair. He looked at the dresser: plain dull wood with dull
scroll work about the mirror. On the dresser was a dingy
white cloth and on the cloth were a pair of brushes, his
wallet, and a collection of small things. Nothing suggested
an unpleasant dream.</p>

<p>The morning light glowed yellowly through the window
shade. There was a band of brighter light between the bottom
of the shade and the window sill and here the daylight
shone into the square room where Robert Holton lived. He
looked at the sunlight a moment and forgot his dream.</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch: fifteen minutes to eight. He had
to be at the office at eight-thirty. Quickly he tied his shoes
and got to his feet. He searched through the bureau drawers
for a shirt. He found a white one and put it on. Before the
war he had worn colored shirts but now plain white ones
seemed more sound. And then it was a good idea not to be
too vivid when you worked for a brokerage house.</p>

<p>His tie was pretty, though. It was a striped one, blue and
white. Not a dark sullen blue but a light and casual blue. As
he knotted his tie in front of the mirror he noticed his face
was pale. He was always pale in the morning, of course; still,
he looked unhealthy in the city. This morning he looked
paler than usual. There were no pouches under his eyes,
though, and he was glad of that. Robert Holton looked
younger than twenty-six. His features were boyish and undistinguished
and certain women had said that he was handsome.
Robert Holton had looked well in uniform.</p>

<p>He put on his trousers and tightened the belt. Robert Holton,
though he had never been much of an athlete, had a
good build. Sitting at desks, however, would ruin it sooner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
or later and the thought made him sad. There was nothing
he could do, of course, for he would always sit at desks.</p>

<p>He picked up his coat from the chair where he had hung
it the night before and put it on. He posed for a moment in
front of the mirror. Perhaps he was not handsome but he
was nicer looking than a great many people and it is better
to be nicer looking than a great many people than to be unusually
handsome.</p>

<p>Robert Holton turned from the window and went into the
bathroom. His watch was on the tile floor beside the bathtub
where he had left it the night before. He set the watch
by his alarm clock.</p>

<p>Again he tried to recall his dream. On the wall there was
a picture of some apples on a table. A Frenchman had
painted the picture twenty years before. It had been reproduced
and the hotel had bought several copies because they
were cheap and because the manager‚Äôs wife had thought the
picture pleasant. Robert Holton liked the picture. It seemed
to suggest his dream to him more than anything else in the
room. He studied the picture but he could not remember
the dream. The picture only made him uneasy. He looked
away.</p>

<p>He went to the closet and took out his trench coat. He
had bought it when he became a lieutenant three years
before.</p>

<p>It was almost eight o‚Äôclock now. Robert Holton opened
the door of his room and stepped out into the corridor.</p>

<p>There was a difference in smell. The corridor smelled old
and dusty as though no one had walked down it in years.
Robert Holton in the one year he had lived in this hotel had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
never seen anyone else come out of a room. Sometimes he
wondered if he might not be the only person living on this
floor, or in this hotel, or in the world.</p>

<p>The ceiling of the corridor was high and he enjoyed walking
under such a high ceiling. He walked to the elevator and
pressed the button marked ‚ÄúDown.‚Äù</p>

<p>There was a large pot filled with white sand beside the
elevator door. He had always wanted to put something into
that white sand. A cigarette butt, anything at all to spoil the
white smooth surface. One day he would spit on the sand;
he made himself that promise.</p>

<p>There was a clatter as the elevator went past his floor.
That always happened. He pushed the button angrily.</p>

<p>Robert Holton tried to recall what he was supposed to do
that day at the office. He could think of nothing very important
that had to be done. In the afternoon he was supposed
to go to a cocktail party and he looked forward to that. Mrs
Raymond Stevanson was giving it and she was a very proper
person to know. She had been a friend of his mother‚Äôs and
she had been nice to Robert Holton when his mother had
died several years earlier. His father thought Mrs Raymond
Stevanson was stupid but his father was often harsh and she
was, after all, important socially. When one was starting out
in the brokerage business contacts were important. He began
to map his day in detail.</p>

<p>There was a loud rattling and the elevator stopped at his
floor. The door opened and Robert Holton stepped into the
elevator.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood morning, Mr Holton,‚Äù said the elevator boy, a
young man in his middle teens.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood morning, Joe. What kind of a day is it?‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúWonderful out. Real warm for this time of year. Real
Indian summer outside. Real nice weather.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine,‚Äù said Robert Holton, glad to hear that the
weather was good.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAny news on the market?‚Äù asked Joe, stopping at the
seventh floor.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNothing new.‚Äù A middle-aged man, tall and thin, came
into the elevator. Robert Holton had seen him almost every
day for a year but they never spoke. The middle-aged man
wore a black shiny topcoat and he carried a large leather
brief case in which the outlines of an apple could be seen.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI guess there‚Äôs nothing for me to put my money in, I
guess,‚Äù said Joe.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt advise buying now,‚Äù said Robert Holton. It
was a daily joke of theirs. Joe would pretend he had money
to invest and wanted advice.</p>

<p>They stopped at the second floor and another tall thin
man in a shiny black overcoat got into the elevator. This man
had a red face, though, and the other man had a white face.
Neither of them ever spoke. Robert Holton often wondered
what they did for a living, whether they had wives or not.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, here we are,‚Äù said Joe, opening the door. ‚ÄúWe made
it all right this time.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe certainly did.‚Äù Robert Holton followed the two older
men out of the elevator and into the lobby.</p>

<p>The lobby was high-ceilinged and old-fashioned. Tropical
bushes grew in buckets and a gray chandelier was suspended
from the center of the ceiling. At the desk sat a faded little
woman.</p>

<p>She nodded to Robert Holton and he nodded to her. They
never spoke. He picked up a newspaper from the desk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
looked at his mail box to see if he might have overlooked
something the night before. Finding nothing, he put three
cents in a saucer beside the newspapers.</p>

<p>Robert Holton went outside. The morning was clear and
cool. There was a depth, a golden depth in the air. There
was no time of the year as pleasant as autumn, thought Robert
Holton; unless it was spring. He liked spring, too.</p>

<p>He walked down the not yet busy side street where he
lived. His footsteps sounded sharp and loud on the pavement.
The brownstone houses that lined the street seemed
large and significant this morning. Perhaps it was because
of the clearness of the day. He noticed details in the stone
that he had never noticed before. For instance, one of the
houses was built of oddly pitted stone. He had seen another
place built of pitted stone. He thought a moment: Notre
Dame, the cathedral in Paris. During the war he had seen
it. He had even walked up a great many winding steps to
get to the top. At the top he had noticed the pitted stone
which had proved, somehow or other, that the building was
very old.</p>

<p>Sleepy children were coming out of the houses. They
walked down the street to the bus stop, schoolbooks under
their arms. There was a smell of bacon and coffee in the air
and Robert Holton‚Äôs stomach contracted hungrily.</p>

<p>At the end of the street was the subway station. Every
morning he disappeared down it and every evening he came
up out of it. He spent a lot of time in the subway.</p>

<p>He went down the dirty cement steps. He put a nickel
into the turnstile and walked out onto the cement platform.
Twenty or thirty men and women stood on the platform
with him, waiting for the downtown train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>The express went crashing by them. The noise of these
trains was terrific. After it had passed he had to yawn several
times to clear the deafness from his ears. Then the local
stopped and he got aboard.</p>

<p>He sat next to a stout man who lived in his hotel. Occasionally
they would speak.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the market?‚Äù asked the fat man, deciding not to
read his paper.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe market‚Äôs doing fine, should go up.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, that sure is good news. I‚Äôve a little bit that I‚Äôd like
to put in it. I‚Äôd like to put it in something safe, though. You
know of something safe? Something that‚Äôs going to go way
up, say?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs a hard question. It‚Äôs very hard to tell just
yet. Sugar‚Äôs doing well,‚Äù said Robert Holton. He always said
the same things to these questions. No one cared what he said.
They would repeat it to acquaintances, saying that a friend
of theirs in Wall Street had advised them to buy sugar but
they didn‚Äôt feel it was such a good buy at this time.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou was in the army, weren‚Äôt you?‚Äù asked the stout man
suddenly.</p>

<p>Robert Holton nodded.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBeen out long?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOver a year.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll bet you was glad to get out. To get away from all
those rules and things, those restrictions. I was in the army
in the last war. I guess the one before last, you‚Äôd call it now.
I was sure glad to get out.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúEveryone is,‚Äù said Robert Holton and he thought of the
things that he had done in London. He had liked London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúYou went to college, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù asked the stout man;
he was trying to clear up something in his mind.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought. Me, I never had the opportunity.
I had to go to work,‚Äù said the stout man with pride. ‚ÄúI had
to work when I was a youngster. I never went to college.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good experience,‚Äù said Robert Holton, wishing the
man would read his paper and stop asking questions. The
train went around a corner noisily; blue electric sparks sparkled
outside the window. Then the train straightened out
again.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the grocery business,‚Äù said the stout man.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI know,‚Äù said Robert Holton, ‚Äúwe‚Äôve talked about that
before.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI started right in at the bottom,‚Äù said the stout man.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the best place to start,‚Äù said Robert Holton, feeling
that there was no answer to this. He was wrong.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs hard to say. How <em>did</em> you like the
army?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt bad.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt good neither. I never got overseas last time, I
mean time before last, but we had it rough in training.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI can imagine.‚Äù Robert Holton looked away and the stout
man stopped talking. Robert Holton looked at the upper
moulding of the car to see if there were any new advertisements.
There weren‚Äôt any. His special favorite, a girl advertising
beer, was behind him and he couldn‚Äôt see it. Gloomily
he examined a fat red child devouring a piece of bread. This
was the advertisement he liked least. He looked away.</p>

<p>A woman with a small child sat across from him, directly
under the bread advertisement. The woman was heavy with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
a roll of flesh around her middle; she wore a tight black
dress. The child with her was about the age of the one in
the picture. This child was pale, though, pale and fat.</p>

<p>A Negro was asleep next to the woman and child. He was
long and thin and his bare ankles and wrists looked like
brown wood. Two Jewish secretaries with yellow hair talked
brightly together. They were young women and wore gaily
colored clothes and their plump legs were hairless and pink.</p>

<p>An old woman with gray hair and deep lines in her face
looked at the two young women and seemed to hate them in
a secret womanly manner. Several young boys, wearing discarded
army clothing, sat in a corner, their schoolbooks beside
them. They talked in hoarse changing voices. Robert
Holton could not hear what they were saying but their voices
seemed to speak of sexual things.</p>

<p>The train stopped at a station and the stout man left. Two
more stops and Robert Holton would get off.</p>

<p>The car was beginning to empty. Only the two girls were
opposite him. They still talked brightly and laughed too
loudly, conscious that he was watching them.</p>

<p>The train made its two stops and the girls got off. No one
sat opposite him now. He studied the advertisements.</p>

<p>Then his stop was made. Quickly he got up, his trench coat
under his arm. He went out onto the platform and before
the train left he looked in again through the window. Slightly
to the right of where he had been sitting was the picture of
the girl advertising beer. He looked at her until the train
pulled out.</p>

<p>When the train was gone he turned and walked up the
dirty cement steps and as he walked he wished that he had
a girl as pretty as the one who advertised beer.</p>

</div>


<p class="p2">‚ÄúHurry up, Marjorie. Let‚Äôs get those tables cleaned up.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Marjorie Ventusa, ‚Äúyes, Mrs Merrin, I certainly
will,‚Äù she spoke sweetly, hoping that Mrs Merrin would get
the sarcasm in her voice but Mrs Merrin was already at the
other end of the restaurant talking to another waitress.</p>

<p>Marjorie pushed her natural blonde hair out of her eyes.
She was never able to keep it in order; perhaps she should
have it cut shorter, wear a snood perhaps. Mrs Merrin was
watching her, she noticed. Quickly Marjorie began to put
the dirty dishes on her tray.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>People were coming in and out of the restaurant. It got a
lot of the less wealthy Wall Street trade. Clerks and secretaries
and stenographers had breakfast and lunch here and
the lonelier ones had supper here. When her tray was full
she went back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>On the other side of the swinging doors the cooks, wearing
fairly clean aprons and white hats, were cooking at ranges.
There was always steam and the smell of soap in the air.
People shouted at one another and it was like a war. Marjorie
hated the kitchen. The front part of the restaurant was
all right. She had been a waitress off and on for fifteen years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
and she didn‚Äôt mind noisy people and the clattering of dishes.</p>

<p>She put some glasses of water on her tray before she left
the kitchen. Then Marjorie Ventusa gave the swinging door
a kick and walked back into the dining room. She had five
tables to take care of.</p>

<p>Two women were seated at the table she had just cleared.
She could tell from the backs of their heads that they were
secretaries and older women; this meant they would be very
particular and leave a ten-cent tip for both of them.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù said Marjorie Ventusa, smiling brightly
and thinking of nothing at all. She put the water glasses on
the table. The two women were frowning at their menus.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow much extra is a large orange juice?‚Äù asked one.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ten cents more if you take it with the breakfast.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAll right, I‚Äôll take a double orange juice, some toast and
coffee. Do you have any marmalade?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, bring some of that, too.‚Äù</p>

<p>The other woman said, ‚ÄúThe same for me.‚Äù Marjorie Ventusa
picked up their menus. As she was turning to go she
saw Robert Holton come into the restaurant and she was
suddenly happy. She smiled at him and he, seeing her,
smiled back. She pointed to one of her tables and he sat
down at it. Quickly she went back to the kitchen to give her
orders. She pushed her hair back from her face and promised
herself that she would get a snood the next day.</p>

<p>Marjorie Ventusa liked Robert Holton. For a year he had
been coming into the restaurant; he always spoke pleasantly
to her and they would joke together. She had never seen him
anywhere except in the restaurant. She knew that he never
really noticed her but she was always glad to see him and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
she was delighted when he talked to her and smiled at her;
his smile was pleasant and he had nice teeth. She thought
him handsome.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood morning, Mr Holton,‚Äù she said, putting a glass of
water and some silverware on his table.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow‚Äôre you today, Marjorie? You look perfect.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSure, sure, I do; I‚Äôm a real beauty.‚Äù Marjorie always felt
awkward with him, as though she couldn‚Äôt think of the right
words to say. She was older than he was, too. Marjorie was
thirty-seven; she had known a lot of men and still she was
awkward with him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat you going to have this morning?‚Äù she asked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell....‚Äù He drawled the word as he looked at the
menu and she had a strong urge to touch the short dark
hairs on the back of his neck. She tried to think of some
excuse to do so. Then she was angry with herself for having
thought of such a thing.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll have some orange juice and scrambled eggs
and bacon.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIs that all you going to eat? Why, how you ever going to
get big and strong?‚Äù</p>

<p>He laughed. ‚ÄúNot sitting at a desk and eating your cooking.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, is that so?‚Äù Marjorie Ventusa walked slowly back to
the kitchen. She felt strained as she walked for she could
feel he was watching her. She wished suddenly that her hips
weren‚Äôt so big and that her legs were slimmer.</p>

<p>She shouted his order to the cooks, then she took the two
secretaries‚Äô breakfasts out to them. They complained bitterly
about the size of the orange juice and one said that it was
too sour and the other said that there were seeds in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù said Marjorie, ‚Äúwould you like something
else?‚Äù</p>

<p>They said they would not and acted as if she had grown
the oranges badly and had put seeds in the juice. One of her
other tables was full now and she went and took their order.</p>

<p>Out in the kitchen his breakfast was ready and she put it
on her tray. There were some seeds in the orange juice which
she carefully removed with a spoon.</p>

<p>He was reading his paper when she came back. He didn‚Äôt
look up as she arranged the dishes on his table.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, here‚Äôs your breakfast,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou better eat it
while it‚Äôs hot.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, sure.‚Äù Robert Holton folded his paper and laid it on
the table. She watched him as he drank the orange juice.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSour, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù she asked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúA little bit, maybe.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre not going to complain. The rest, they all
complain all the time. I get so tired sometimes I could get
sick; I get so tired of listening to them.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt take them seriously. Everybody feels awful in
the morning. You‚Äôve just been awake longer and you feel
better than they do, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù</p>

<p>Marjorie Ventusa laughed admiringly. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have
ever thought of that,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou might be right. Anyway
a girl gets pretty tired of being shouted at all the time like
it‚Äôs her fault.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, just relax. I like the food and the service.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she said, trying to sound elegant and funny
at the same time.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhen you going to go out dancing with me?‚Äù Robert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
Holton asked, sawing a piece of bacon in half with a blunt
knife.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty busy,‚Äù she said; she always said that when he
asked her that question. He would say it because he thought
it was funny and she would answer him as though she thought
it was funny too. She wished that he meant it now. She had
always wished that he meant it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty busy,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúI got so many people asking to go out with me. You‚Äôd have
to wait couple of weeks, maybe.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI can wait,‚Äù he said, smiling at her; smiling the way he
would to a child, she thought suddenly. She watched him
eat.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMarjorie,‚Äù said a voice behind her.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, Mrs Merrin, I‚Äôm coming. I‚Äôll be right with you. I was
just cleaning this table.‚Äù</p>

<p>Mrs Merrin was tall and stout with a wide loose mouth
which she could make look stern and harsh when she wanted
to. She made it look that way now.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMarjorie,‚Äù she said in a low voice, ‚Äúyou stop your hanging
around and talking to the customers. I tell you I won‚Äôt
stand for it.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Mrs Merrin. I was just cleaning the table.‚Äù
Mrs Merrin smiled warmly at Robert Holton and walked
away.</p>

<p>‚ÄúShe‚Äôs an awful bitch,‚Äù said Marjorie Ventusa.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat did she say?‚Äù asked Robert Holton. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear
her.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúShe was just running off at the mouth, that‚Äôs all. She
thought I was talking too much to you.‚Äù</p>

<p>One of her tables called for a check and she walked over
quickly and put their used plates on her tray. Then she went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
back to the kitchen. More orders were ready for her. She
loaded her tray and went back to work.</p>

<p>As she worked she watched Robert Holton. It was twenty
minutes past eight and she knew that he had to be at his
office at eight-thirty. She hoped that he would stay as long
as possible. His office was only a block away and he would
be able to stay until eight-thirty. He ate slowly, she knew,
and he would read his paper as he ate.</p>

<p>She hurried back to the kitchen. Two waitresses were talking
and laughing together in a corner. They were young and
pretty and would probably marry in another year and never
work again; in another year Marjorie Ventusa would still be
waiting on tables.</p>

<p>She stopped in front of the mirror behind the swinging
doors. Mrs Merrin always said that neatness was an important
thing.</p>

<p>Marjorie Ventusa rubbed the kitchen steam from the mirror.
Her hair was back in her face again. She pushed it
viciously out of her eyes. She hated its color. It was pale
blonde, a real pale blonde. But because she was getting
older and because she was part Italian everyone thought
that she dyed her hair. She wondered if perhaps she
shouldn‚Äôt have it colored black. Her eyebrows were dark,
thin and dark, and that made the color of her hair look even
more suspicious.</p>

<p>A sailor she had seen several times during the war had told
her that she had a beautiful figure and she had tried to believe
him. She was too heavy, though. Well, she hadn‚Äôt been
heavy at that time. At least not quite so heavy as she was
now. She wondered what kind of women Robert Holton
liked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúMarjorie,‚Äù said Mrs Merrin. That was all Mrs Merrin said
as she walked by. Marjorie Ventusa was glad. One day she
would lose her temper and get fired.</p>

<p>The mirror had steamed up again. She took her tray and
went out into the dining room. More customers had come.
She put glasses of water and silverware on their tables and
took their orders and gave them instructions in how to order
and how to avoid paying extra for what they wanted.</p>

<p>Robert Holton was halfway through his breakfast. She
looked at the clock over the kitchen doors. It was twenty-seven
minutes after eight o‚Äôclock. She would work very hard
now to get her orders taken care of and then she would have
a few minutes to talk to him before he left. She usually
couldn‚Äôt talk to him at lunch because he was always with
someone else.</p>

<p>Marjorie Ventusa traveled quickly back and forth from
kitchen to dining room and back again. Her hair was hopelessly
out of shape now and she was perspiring.</p>

<p>Finally her last customer was satisfied for the moment.
She wandered casually over to Robert Holton‚Äôs table.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBreakfast good?‚Äù she asked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNever better.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat don‚Äôt make it so good.‚Äù They laughed. He was always
so polite with her. That was why she liked him, she
thought. He was very kind. He was handsome, too, but that
wasn‚Äôt as important as being polite. A lot of fine people were
not handsome.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in the paper?‚Äù she asked. She never quite knew
what to talk about when she was with him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNot much. The same old stuff. Election stuff mostly.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSeems like there‚Äôs always an election.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôre a lot of them.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI almost don‚Äôt read any newspapers. I don‚Äôt seem to get
time to read them. I‚Äôll bet you read a lot of them.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI have to. I read all about the market.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, you‚Äôre in Wall Street. That must be exciting.
Working there where all those big deals are made.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt make them where I am.‚Äù He laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm
just another worker.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI thought you were way up in one of the big houses.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, sort of a clerk which doesn‚Äôt pay much. It‚Äôs a good
way to starve.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou ought to do something different. Suppose you marry
some girl....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not getting married for a long time.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI suppose,‚Äù said Marjorie Ventusa calmly, ‚Äúthat you got
some nice society girl all lined up.‚Äù</p>

<p>Robert Holton shook his head. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt any girl anywhere.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that like life. All the handsome men don‚Äôt have girls
and they wonder why so many of us are old maids.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not an old maid yet, Marjorie. By the way, what‚Äôs
your last name? As long as I‚Äôve known you I‚Äôve never known
your last name.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúVentusa.‚Äù She spelled it for him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúItalian name?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúMy father was Italian, my mother was Irish.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good combination. I knew a lot of pretty girls
when I was in Italy.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWere you there in the war?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI was there over a year.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI always wanted to travel. I guess I‚Äôd rather travel than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
do anything. My father, he used to tell me stories about
Italy. He came from Sicily. Were you ever in Sicily?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, I was in Sicily.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beautiful, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBeautiful.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúMust be real messed up now.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNot too bad. The scenery‚Äôs still there.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go there someday,‚Äù said Marjorie Ventusa,
knowing that she never would.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôll like it.‚Äù</p>

<p>Mrs Merrin was looking at her and she pretended to be
busy at his table.</p>

<p>‚ÄúLet me get you some more coffee,‚Äù she said. She picked
up the plates from his table and put them on her tray. Her
arm touched his hand. He pulled away unconsciously, and
she walked back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>She got a cup of coffee for him. Two other orders were
ready for her. She put them on her tray and returned to the
dining room.</p>

<p>She noticed a girl was walking over to Robert Holton‚Äôs
table. She had seen the girl often before. She worked in Robert
Holton‚Äôs office. Occasionally they would have lunch together.
She was a pretty girl. Her hair was dark and her skin
white. Her lips were full and painted a deep red. She had a
slim figure and slim legs and her eyes were blue, a deep vivid
blue that Marjorie Ventusa envied. The girl spoke to Robert
Holton. He stood up. Then they both sat down.</p>

<p>Marjorie Ventusa took care of two tables and then she
went to Robert Holton‚Äôs table and placed his cup of coffee
before him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù she said to the pretty girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù said the pretty girl absently. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have
some grapefruit juice. That‚Äôs all I want. I‚Äôm reducing,‚Äù she
said to Robert Holton and she patted her slim waist.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat on earth are you reducing for?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou think I look all right this way?‚Äù she asked, pretending
surprise.</p>

<p>Marjorie Ventusa hurried to the kitchen. She hated this
pretty girl. All day long Robert Holton was with her. Perhaps
even at night they were together. She pushed her
blonde hair back out of her face. If only she had been pretty
and young. Of course, she had been young but she had
never been pretty. She was far from old now. They said that
if one wanted something badly enough one would get it.
That was foolish; Marjorie Ventusa had never gotten anything
she wanted, except a yellow satin dress. When she was
a child she had wanted a yellow satin dress and her father
had bought her one. The dress was in a box in her closet
now; she had not looked at it in fifteen years. She picked up
a glass of grapefruit juice and put it on her tray.</p>

<p>The pretty girl was laughing when she came back to their
table and Robert Holton was watching her. She wore a gray
suit buttoned tightly across her small breasts.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your grapefruit juice.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThank you very much,‚Äù said the girl, paying no attention
to Marjorie Ventusa, saying the words mechanically.</p>

<p>The waitress began to clean the table next to Robert Holton‚Äôs.
She rubbed the gray damp cloth over the shiny black
table-top and she listened to Robert Holton and the pretty
girl as they talked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut Caroline‚Äù (her name was Caroline then), ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt
know you were expecting me last night.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, we weren‚Äôt really. I just thought you might come
on over, that‚Äôs all. We had quite a gang. Jimmy Hammond,
he was at Yale about the same time you were.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI went to Harvard.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, you did. Well, you would‚Äôve liked Jimmy
Hammond. He was in the army, too. And there were a whole
lot of people around. I just thought you‚Äôd have liked to
come.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI certainly would‚Äôve but I didn‚Äôt remember your inviting
me.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all right,‚Äù said Caroline, drinking her grapefruit
juice and making a face as she did. ‚ÄúGod, but this stuff is
sour.‚Äù</p>

<p>Marjorie Ventusa, having cleaned the shiny black table-top
cleaner than it had ever been before, turned to another
table. She was still close enough to hear what they said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat did you do last night, Bobby?‚Äù She called him
Bobby. Marjorie Ventusa wondered if she would ever be
able to call him that.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNot a thing. I went home to bed early.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNext time I‚Äôll send you an engraved invitation when I
want you to come to the house.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou do that. What time‚Äôs it getting to be?‚Äù</p>

<p>Caroline looked at the clock. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not much after eight-thirty.
Let‚Äôs take our time.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to be too late.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt been around long. Nobody gets there on
time. What‚Äôre you bucking for, Mr Holton?‚Äù</p>

<p>He grinned at her. Robert Holton had dark blue eyes.
Marjorie Ventusa had never noticed them before. They were
beautiful eyes, she thought suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>One of the waitresses came over to her and said, ‚ÄúBoy, you
sure must like that guy in the corner.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat do you mean? What you talking about?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNothing at all. You needn‚Äôt get so excited. I was just
noticing you talking to him all the time. I couldn‚Äôt help
noticing, Marjorie. You was there so long talking to him.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHe comes in here a lot and we talk, that‚Äôs all. I hope <em>you</em>
don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind at all, Marjorie. I was just kidding you.‚Äù</p>

<p>Marjorie Ventusa picked up a cup of coffee and went back
to the dining room. The waitress had irritated her. She didn‚Äôt
want anyone to think that she would fall for a man at least
ten years younger than she was. Well, perhaps not ten years.
Robert Holton could be thirty. The difference between thirty
and thirty-seven was not so great.</p>

<p>She walked over to Robert Holton‚Äôs table. They were
talking.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see what you have against Dick. He‚Äôs an awful
nice fellow.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have anything against him. He just doesn‚Äôt like
me. He thinks I‚Äôm trying to get his job.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, are you?‚Äù</p>

<p>Robert Holton smiled. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anything; didn‚Äôt you
know that?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, aren‚Äôt you the saint. You mean you wouldn‚Äôt like
to take his job? Not even if it was offered to you?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI suppose if it were easier to take a job than refuse it
I‚Äôd take the job. I‚Äôm easy to please.‚Äù</p>

<p>Caroline sighed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre easy to please. I guess that‚Äôs what
war does to you.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI was always like that. I was like that at college.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúJust lazy?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúJust lazy.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood Lord, it‚Äôs almost nine! We have to get out of here.‚Äù</p>

<p>Robert Holton waved to Marjorie Ventusa. She came over
to their table slowly. She didn‚Äôt want him to leave any
sooner than he had to.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGot my check, Marjorie?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll get it for you.‚Äù She went to the cashier and had his
check totalled for him. Then she brought it back and he paid
her, leaving a ten-cent tip under his water glass.</p>

<p>Caroline stood up and put her gray coat about her shoulders.
Robert Holton picked up his trench coat and slung it
over his arm.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you at lunch, Marjorie,‚Äù he said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSee you,‚Äù said Marjorie Ventusa and she watched them
as they went out the door into the bright autumn morning.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSay, Marjorie,‚Äù said one of her regular customers, ‚Äúhow
about some more coffee.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúO.K., O.K.,‚Äù she said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhen are you going to get those tables cleaned?‚Äù said
Mrs Merrin who was back in Marjorie Ventusa‚Äôs corner. ‚ÄúI
wish you‚Äôd try to get them done right after the customers
leave. I wish you‚Äôd make some effort, Marjorie.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù said Marjorie Ventusa.</p>

<p>She began to clear Robert Holton‚Äôs table.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat about my coffee?‚Äù asked the customer. ‚ÄúWhen I
going to get it?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúRight away.‚Äù Marjorie Ventusa finished cleaning Robert
Holton‚Äôs table. Almost sadly she pocketed the ten-cent tip
which he had left under the water glass.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><em>Chapter Three</em></h2>
</div>


<p class="p2">The elevator door opened and Caroline Lawson and Robert
Holton stepped out of it and into the New York office of
Heywood and Golden, members of the New York Stock Exchange
and other organizations equally sound.</p>

<p>The entrance hall was modern and dignified. The walls
were clean and white and there was a thick carpet on the
floor. Two heavy leather couches furnished the entrance. A
dark genteel girl sat behind a reception desk.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood morning, Caroline,‚Äù she said in a nasal voice.
‚ÄúGood morning, Bob.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHello, Ruth,‚Äù said Robert Holton, and Caroline Lawson
smiled at her.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnything new?‚Äù asked Robert Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNot a thing, Bob, not a thing. Everything‚Äôs just as dull as
ever. Of course, it‚Äôs still early.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSure,‚Äù said Caroline, amused at the thought of anything
interesting happening to them, ‚Äúthe day‚Äôs just started.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIs the boss in yet?‚Äù asked Robert Holton. He was terribly
afraid of getting in bad, thought Caroline, looking at him.
He was rather cowardly but nice. Perhaps having been in
the war had changed him. Perhaps he would improve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>Ruth shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs not in yet. He hasn‚Äôt come
in yet. He‚Äôs always late, Mr Murphy is.‚Äù Mr Murphy was the
head of the Statistical Section where Robert Holton worked.
Caroline was Mr Murphy‚Äôs secretary.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm glad,‚Äù said Robert Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou certainly <em>are</em> eager,‚Äù said Ruth, looking up at him,
her head slightly to one side: the way that movie actresses
looked.</p>

<p>Robert Holton laughed. ‚ÄúI guess I am.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd after all you‚Äôve been through, too! Why, if I‚Äôd seen
what you‚Äôve seen I wouldn‚Äôt worry what nob ... anybody
thought.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I used to say,‚Äù said Robert Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCome on, Bob,‚Äù said Caroline. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get back to the salt
mine.‚Äù</p>

<p>Ruth nodded to them and they walked into a long room.
On one side of the room were the doors of offices; the other
side was covered with tremendous pictures of factories and
ships and railroads. The pictures were Mr Golden‚Äôs idea. He
wanted to explain to customers the real meaning of the
stocks they were buying. Mr Golden always wanted people
to feel that the stock market was a creative, a productive
thing.</p>

<p>Women of all ages sat typing at small desks in the long
room. The light was indirect and modern and very even. One
could see that Heywood and Golden was a well-organized
house.</p>

<p>People murmured good mornings to Caroline and Robert
Holton as they walked together between the desks. At the
end of the room there was a glass door behind which were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
a large blackboard, ticker tape machines, and men recording
the prices of the various stocks.</p>

<p>‚ÄúLook busy, don‚Äôt they?‚Äù commented Caroline.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThey certainly do. I wouldn‚Äôt have that job for anything.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think it‚Äôd be sort of exciting.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúToo much running around for me. I like to sit still.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt takes,‚Äù said Caroline, ‚Äúall kinds to make up a world.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that lucky?‚Äù said Robert Holton and Caroline didn‚Äôt
know whether he was laughing at her or not. Sometimes he
bothered her. She liked him. Almost everybody did because
he was nice-looking and quiet. He was weak, though, she
thought. She didn‚Äôt like a man to be weak. She wanted someone
that she could lean on. Caroline Lawson was one of
those pretty girls who could never bear weak men and yet,
by nature, hated those who were stronger.</p>

<p>They stood and watched the ticker tape machines through
the glass door. A tall white-faced boy was slowly marking
figures on the blackboard. He stood on a small stepladder
and as he wrote the figures his left foot tapped regularly
and rhythmically on the top step of the ladder. Caroline
wondered what tune he was making.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou like to dance, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù she asked suddenly.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat? Dance? Sure, I like to dance. Why?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt know. I was just thinking, that‚Äôs all. I like to
dance a whole lot. When I was at college we used to have
wonderful dances.‚Äù</p>

<p>Robert Holton laughed. ‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt so long ago, when
you were at college. Don‚Äôt you go out any more?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOf course I do. You know I do, all the time, and I‚Äôm not
trying to get you to ask me out either.‚Äù</p>

<p>He laughed at her and that was all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>Caroline looked at him and tried to guess what he was
thinking. He was probably thinking that she was very pretty
and that he would like to ask her to go out with him. She
wouldn‚Äôt go out with him, he knew. Not now, not after she
had said these things. Later, perhaps, when they had forgotten
the words she had said. Caroline sighed as she thought
of her own strength and of his weakness.</p>

<p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get back to the office,‚Äù said Holton.</p>

<p>They walked down a short corridor. At the end of the corridor
was the Statistical room. Here a dozen men and women
worked at desks. They compiled figures for the executives
and the customers and everyone else in the house.</p>

<p>Through a noise of automatic welcomes, Caroline and
Robert Holton went into the office. Most of the desks were
on the side of the room away from the windows. The windowed
end of the room was protected by a railing; behind
the railing was Mr Murphy‚Äôs desk and at a respectful distance
from his desk was Caroline Lawson‚Äôs.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSee you later, Bob,‚Äù said Caroline and she opened the
door of the railing and went into the windowed section of
the room. She let the door swing creakily shut and went to
her desk. Glancing sideways, she watched Robert Holton go
to his desk at the other end of the office. Then she sat down.</p>

<p>The desk was neat. A new blotter was in the center. An
inkwell, without ink in it, and a penholder, without a pen in
it, held the top of the blotter down. A slim imitation silver
vase sat on one corner of the desk. Occasionally Mr Murphy
would put a flower in the vase and she would smile at him
when he did that and Mr Murphy would wink at her.</p>

<p>One of the two phones on her desk rang. She picked up
the receiver. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù Someone asked for Mr Murphy. ‚ÄúHe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
isn‚Äôt in right now; shall I have him call you? You‚Äôll call back
later? Thank you.‚Äù She cleared her throat, cleared her professional
telephone voice away.</p>

<p>She moved the blotter to one end of the desk. Then she
lifted the front of her desk and a typewriter appeared. She
ran her fingers over the keys, professionally, like a pianist
before he begins to play.</p>

<p>She opened the left-hand top drawer of the desk. This was
her personal drawer. Here were several compacts in various
stages of use. A slightly crushed box of pale green Kleenex, a
carton of cigarettes, and a box of fairly expensive candy. The
lid of the candy box was off and Caroline Lawson decided
that, since her breakfast had been small, a little candy
wouldn‚Äôt hurt her. She picked the largest piece and put it
in her mouth.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood morning, Caroline. How‚Äôs the girl?‚Äù It was Mr
Murphy.</p>

<p>Caroline swallowed quickly. ‚ÄúFine, fine, Mr Murphy.
How‚Äôre you today?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúMe? I‚Äôm just fine today. Certainly is a wonderful day
today. Makes you feel like going out in the country somewhere.
Out to Long Island or some place like that. Go some
place to get away from the city.‚Äù Mr Murphy sighed. He had
spent all his life in the city and he wanted to go live in the
country. He would not like the country, of course, but then
he would never leave the city and it made no difference.</p>

<p>‚ÄúLook what I brought you,‚Äù said Mr Murphy. He pulled a
slightly rumpled white carnation from his buttonhole. ‚ÄúWe
had a big blowout at the Astor last night. It was quite a show
we had.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù said Caroline, smiling at him. She smelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
the white flower; a strong odor of cigar smoke spoiled the
scent. ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù she said again and she put the white
flower in the tall vase.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAny calls? Anything new?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou had one call. No message, though. The man said he‚Äôd
call back later.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood.‚Äù Mr Murphy sat down at his desk.</p>

<p>There was a pile of letters on his desk. Very precisely he
cut the letters open one by one. Caroline watched him with
a mixture of admiration and dislike.</p>

<p>Oliver L. Murphy was a tall man. He was heavy but not in
the usual manner. His arms and legs and neck were long and
thin and his hips were narrow; his stomach and chest, however,
were massive. He held himself erect. His face was red
as all Irishmen‚Äôs faces are supposed to be. His eyes and hair
were dark and he had a thick curved nose. Mr Murphy‚Äôs
clothes fitted him well. They were usually of a somber color
and always correct. His cuffs were beautifully starched.</p>

<p>For five years Caroline Lawson had been his secretary.
Her first job had been as his secretary; her last job, too, she
thought to herself: she would be married soon and that would
be the end of typing and putting cigar-scented flowers in
fake silver vases. Caroline Lawson was not sure whom she
would marry but she would certainly get married to someone
soon.</p>

<p>Mr Murphy finished reading his letters.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnything important?‚Äù asked Caroline.</p>

<p>Mr Murphy shook his head. ‚ÄúNot much of anything. We
got one letter here I ought to answer.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll get my pad.‚Äù Caroline picked up a lightly ruled pad
of paper from her desk. Then she went over and sat down in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
a chair beside Mr Murphy‚Äôs desk. She sat close to the window
so that the morning sunlight would warm her. As she
sat down bits of dust vibrated up into the sunlight from her
chair seat. The motes of dust danced and glittered and then
slowly sank along the beams of light to the floor.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready,‚Äù said Caroline Lawson.</p>

<p>Mr Murphy cleared his throat and looked helplessly about
him. It was his usual beginning. Then he picked up the letter
he was to answer. He waited a moment for the words to
come to him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDear,‚Äù he began. She made the figure for the word. He
paused, studying the ceiling. He began again, ‚ÄúDear Mr
Lachum, In reply to your letter of the 16th, etc., etc....‚Äù
He stopped and closed his eyes; this seemed to help. ‚ÄúI cannot,
I fear, agree with you in your analysis of certain trends
now at work ... no, now abroad ... in the financial world.‚Äù
His voice became firm and concise, ‚ÄúAlthough I have the
greatest personal esteem for the opinions of yourself and
associates, uh, in re to the stock market, I must, in this instance,
disagree with you, for I am of the opinion that this
is a rising market and will continue to be so. All statistics at
hand ... no, available, point to just that. Hoping to hear
from you again, and so on.‚Äù Mr Murphy stopped and opened
his eyes. He looked pleased and exhilarated.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a very nice letter, Mr Murphy. Knowing Mr
Lachum, I think you were certainly nice to him.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, it never does to offend people, Caroline. That‚Äôs
a rule with me. That‚Äôs something I‚Äôve always followed. I
wouldn‚Äôt be here today if I hadn‚Äôt been that way.‚Äù He paused
and they both thought of a world where there was no Mr
Murphy because he had offended people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúAll right, let‚Äôs hear that letter back.‚Äù</p>

<p>Caroline read the letter. Mr Murphy listened, pleased.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine,‚Äù he said when she had finished. ‚ÄúType it up
please.‚Äù</p>

<p>Caroline went back to her desk. The sunlight and the glittering
dust were almost out of the room now. Soon they
would turn on the fluorescent lights over their desks. Caroline
sometimes wished that the morning would last all day.</p>

<p>Caroline put a piece of paper in her typewriter. She
started to type; then she remembered that all letters must
be done in triplicate. She pulled the sheet of paper out of the
machine. Wearily, enjoying her weariness, she arranged
more paper in the typewriter.</p>

<p>Her fingers moved swiftly over the keys. She made rhythms
as she typed, as the keys clattered on the white paper.</p>

<p>In a few minutes she was finished.</p>

<p>‚ÄúVery nice,‚Äù said Mr Murphy, looking over her shoulder.
‚ÄúVery nice, indeed. I‚Äôll sign that now.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúO.K.‚Äù Caroline took the papers out of the typewriter. She
removed the carbon. Mr Murphy signed the letter carefully.
During the last five years Caroline had watched Mr Murphy‚Äôs
signature change. It was becoming more original; the upstrokes
were stronger and the ‚ÄúM‚Äù was becoming regal.</p>

<p>She blotted his signature. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôll I do next?‚Äù she asked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI expect you‚Äôd better get on those reports for Mr Golden.
He was asking for them yesterday.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat <em>does</em> he think we are? We were only told to do
those reports last week. That takes a lot of time. I don‚Äôt see
what he‚Äôs always in such a rush for.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, you know how some people are,‚Äù said Mr Murphy,
meaning much more than he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>Caroline nodded wisely. Mr Murphy was often opposed to
Mr Golden‚Äôs business ideas. Mr Heywood, who had inherited
a lot of money and never bothered much with business, was
Mr Murphy‚Äôs friend. Mr Golden was a promoter who had
become a partner several years before. The conservative element
of the house stood firmly against him but his hold over
Mr Heywood was equally firm.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll get to work on it right away,‚Äù said Caroline.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood, I think I‚Äôll go up to the front office. If there‚Äôre any
calls tell them I‚Äôll call back.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, Mr Murphy.‚Äù</p>

<p>Smoothly Mr Murphy moved across the room. All of his
movements were smooth and swift. He opened the swinging
gate that separated him from his staff. They didn‚Äôt look up
from their work as he walked between the desks toward the
hall.</p>

<p>Caroline took more paper out of her desk and put it in
her typewriter. She opened a black notebook. Slowly she
began to copy. After a minute or so she stopped. She wasn‚Äôt
concentrating and she didn‚Äôt know what was wrong.</p>

<p>Caroline Lawson leaned back in her swivel chair and her
arms dropped limply at her sides. The sunlight was gone out
of the room and she could no longer see the dust in the
light.</p>

<p>Far away she could hear the sounds of automobile horns
blowing, of newsboy shouts in the street; and, from time to
time, their building would rumble as a train passed underground.</p>

<p>Closer to her were the sounds of the office. The clattering
of typewriters, the constant low buzz of voices; these were
the sounds of her days. Caroline was dissatisfied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>Across the room she could see Robert Holton writing
something in a black book. She pitied him because he seemed
to really like what he was doing. But then it was better than
being a soldier: probably anything was better than that. But
then Robert Holton wasn‚Äôt a woman. That made a lot of difference,
thought Caroline. He couldn‚Äôt be depressed by
things the way she was. Men were never sensitive about such
things. She had a <em>malaise</em>. Having thought of this word, she
was pleased with it. The word described her sudden fits of
depression.</p>

<p>Robert Holton closed the book on his desk. He looked
about him uncertainly. Then he stood up and walked toward
her. He was presentable, she thought. Certainly better looking
than anyone else in Heywood and Golden, but he was
not what she wanted at all. Also, there was some doubt in
her mind that Robert Holton was interested in her.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it going, Caroline?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm slowed up.‚Äù She sighed loudly and wilted in her
chair.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs too bad,‚Äù he said. She didn‚Äôt answer. She was quiet
for a moment. He watched her and she enjoyed his watching
her. Finally he said, ‚ÄúMurphy‚Äôs in a good mood today.‚Äù</p>

<p>Caroline nodded. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs real happy today. He wants to go
out in the country. He always wants to do that when he‚Äôs
feeling good.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs some character,‚Äù said Robert Holton. He sat down
on the railing.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt would be nice,‚Äù said Caroline thoughtfully, ‚Äúto go out
in the country; have a picnic maybe.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSure, that would be nice, but you couldn‚Äôt do that.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, I guess <em>you</em> couldn‚Äôt.‚Äù Caroline was contemptuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
but because she was a very pretty and popular girl she didn‚Äôt
show it. She was sensitive herself and that was what she
wanted in life: a man who was as sensitive as she, someone
who would respond to her moods. She looked at Robert Holton.
He was sitting uneasily on the railing. No, he could
never understand her great sadness. Perhaps no one would
ever understand her. Caroline was sad, for it is a sad thing
to be both pretty and sensitive.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going out tonight, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù</p>

<p>Robert Holton nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to a cocktail party; I‚Äôm
going to Mrs Raymond Stevanson‚Äôs.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, is that so? You‚Äôre really going around in high circles.
I guess I shouldn‚Äôt be associating with high society like you.‚Äù
She had meant to speak lightly and humorously but somehow
the words had come out all wrong and there was a bitterness
in her voice that embarrassed her.</p>

<p>Robert Holton looked surprised; he smiled finally. ‚ÄúWell, it
never hurts to know these people. She was a friend of my
mother‚Äôs,‚Äù he explained, trying to explain these things, to
make himself appear like her; she hated him for his kindness.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThose people are O.K., I guess,‚Äù said Caroline. She started
to say something about her own family, some improbable
but soothing lie, something to prove to herself that she was
the same as Mrs Stevanson whose picture was so often in the
papers. But she said nothing. She played with the ribbon of
her typewriter.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI hate staying in one place,‚Äù said Caroline, after a moment
of silence.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no fun traveling,‚Äù said Robert Holton. ‚ÄúMoving
around all the time; that‚Äôs what I didn‚Äôt like in the army. No,
traveling‚Äôs pretty lousy.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúThat kind is, but I mean to go ... well, you know ...
where you want to go, that‚Äôs what I mean. I don‚Äôt like sitting
around here day after day. I want to go some place.‚Äù</p>

<p>He shrugged. ‚ÄúA lot of people do, I guess. Marjorie, you
know, the waitress, she wants to go to Sicily.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs different. I mean she‚Äôs not ... well, you know
what I mean, she‚Äôs probably happy doing what she‚Äôs doing.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see why,‚Äù said Robert Holton. They thought of
Marjorie Ventusa for a moment then they didn‚Äôt think of her
again.</p>

<p>Robert Holton shifted his position on the railing. Caroline
looked about the familiar room. The older women were typing
and using their adding machines; the younger women
were watching Robert Holton; and the younger men (there
were three of them) looked up occasionally to see what
Caroline was doing. She posed a little for them. She didn‚Äôt
pose haughtily, though. Caroline was too clever for that. She
just looked girlish and rather innocent. None of them could
understand her sadness and her longing. It pleased her to
think how well she hid herself. Not even Robert Holton,
talking to her now, could realize these things.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Robert Holton, ‚Äúno, I want to stay in one place.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to be doing the same thing all the time,
do you?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôd like to make more money.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre crazy,‚Äù she said. She watched her fingers
as they tapped lightly on the keys of the typewriter. Her
hands weren‚Äôt quite what she wanted them to be. She thought
of them as long and slender and faintly exotic; actually her
hands were short and square and not very clean. The red
enamel was beginning to chip off her thumbnails.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy‚Äôm I crazy? Because I want to make more money?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNot because of that, of course. Just because.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh.‚Äù</p>

<p>Robert Holton shifted his position on the railing. Caroline
suddenly didn‚Äôt want him to go. Then Richard Kuppelton
got up from his desk near the door and came over to them.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy, hello, Dick,‚Äù said Caroline.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood morning, good morning,‚Äù said Dick heartily. He
was a very hearty person and Caroline liked him. He was so
different from Robert Holton. Dick always seemed the same;
he acted the same, anyway. Caroline could almost always tell
what he was going to say and that was a lot better than being
around a person who never said the right things. Dick
wasn‚Äôt sensitive, however. He and Robert Holton were the
same that way but then Caroline couldn‚Äôt have everything.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow‚Äôs every little thing?‚Äù asked Dick Kuppelton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFine,‚Äù said Robert Holton. Caroline only smiled; she
smiled with her eyes as well as her mouth. It was important
to smile that way.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBeen pretty slow today,‚Äù said Dick. ‚ÄúNot much business.
I think the market‚Äôs falling off.‚Äù Someone had told him that,
thought Caroline, delighted with her perception.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt may be,‚Äù said Robert Holton without much interest.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe should have a big rush soon. I‚Äôm doing a report now.
Well, not really a report; I‚Äôve been getting some statistics on
aircraft stock ready for the front office. It‚Äôs been some job.‚Äù
He shook his head to show the largeness of the job.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a report like that to do, too,‚Äù said Caroline.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSomething for Golden?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>

<p>Dick nodded knowingly. ‚ÄúSome report, I bet.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs certainly long,‚Äù said Caroline, pointing to the notebook
on her desk.</p>

<p>Robert Holton got off the railing and stretched. ‚ÄúI better
get to work,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMurphy might be back soon.‚Äù He
went back to his desk.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs real eager,‚Äù said Dick unpleasantly.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat? Well, I don‚Äôt know about that. He‚Äôs sort of funny.
He doesn‚Äôt want to get anywhere but he doesn‚Äôt want to get
in bad. I don‚Äôt know; he‚Äôs awful funny.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen those guys before,‚Äù said Dick. ‚ÄúI know that
type. They come in a place and get in good with the top
people. Then they get your job. That‚Äôs just what he‚Äôs up to.‚Äù</p>

<p>Caroline smiled and said nothing. She was pretty and
popular and she couldn‚Äôt always, therefore, say what she
thought. She knew, though, that Dick Kuppelton, who had
been with Heywood and Golden for six years, disliked Holton.
Mr Murphy had never liked Kuppelton and at the end
of the year changes were always made and Robert Holton
might take Dick‚Äôs place. Things were very complicated,
thought Caroline.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs that smart,‚Äù said Caroline.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre wrong.‚Äù Dick started to straddle the railing,
then he changed his mind and leaned against it. He was
a large man. He was thirty and pink and blond. He wore
large rimless glasses which made his face look clean and
blank. He enjoyed what he was doing, thought Caroline.
Everyone enjoyed working except herself.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to do some typing,‚Äù said Caroline. She wanted
him to go away.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCertainly; I suppose I‚Äôd better be getting back.‚Äù He stood
up straight and stretched. ‚ÄúWell, back to work,‚Äù he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúSee you,‚Äù said Caroline. Dick was so dependable: you
always knew what to expect.</p>

<p>Caroline coughed. Her cough had a consumptive sound to
it which rather appealed to her. When she was a young girl
she had seen a play about a beautiful woman with white
flowers and a cough. The beautiful woman had been so interesting
that Caroline had never forgotten her although she
had forgotten the play. Caroline coughed again, quietly,
dramatically.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow‚Äôs that report coming?‚Äù Oliver L. Murphy had returned
from the front office.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPretty well, Mr Murphy.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHad quite a session with Mr Golden.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI bet,‚Äù said Caroline with sympathy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bet he was
something.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, I handled him O.K. today. He‚Äôs not so hard to get
along with. Of course, he‚Äôs got some queer ideas. Those
people often have.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that the truth.‚Äù Caroline arranged the paper in her
typewriter. Mr Murphy leaned over and smelled the carnation
in the imitation silver vase.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSmells nice, don‚Äôt it?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt certainly does, Mr Murphy.‚Äù She smiled. Mr Murphy
went back to his desk and Caroline typed. Several times as
she worked she coughed, quietly, almost to herself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><em>Chapter Four</em></h2>
</div>


<p class="p2">Richard Kuppelton left Caroline reluctantly. He liked
her because she was pretty and much more sensible than the
other pretty girls he had known.</p>

<p>He stopped at his desk. It was a dull olive color. His different
books of statistics were piled neatly on one corner;
notebooks and papers were scattered over the top and it
looked as if he were busy.</p>

<p>Kuppelton decided not to work, not just now. From the
top drawer of his desk he took a magazine. It had a vivid
cover of a large-breasted young woman being carried into a
machine by an octopus. He enjoyed this magazine‚Äôs stories
very much.</p>

<p>He slipped the magazine under his arm, the cover toward
his side; and then, busily, he left the room for the lavatory.</p>

<p>There was something cozy about a lavatory, he thought as
he opened the door marked ‚ÄúMen.‚Äù No one was inside
and he would be able to sing. The room was large, white and
very clean. The urinals, four of them, stood polished and
shining, like soldiers on guard. A thin waterfall constantly
descended down their white enamel surfaces; the smell of
disinfectant was in the air, but not too strongly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>Richard Kuppelton glanced at himself quickly in one of
the four mirrors which shone over the four wash basins. Then
he walked to one of the four black-doored stalls. He chose
the one nearest the wall. There was strategy in his choice as
well as habit, for the light was over this stall.</p>

<p>With the feeling of having come home after a long journey,
Richard Kuppelton opened the black door and stepped
inside. Then he closed the door and locked it. He was completely
alone now; no one could disturb him and he was safe.</p>

<p>Deliberately he hung up his coat and then, after some
preparation, he descended with a sigh upon the cool smooth
seat. He relaxed happily.</p>

<p>On the subway he had started a story called ‚ÄúThe Mad
Moon Maidens‚Äù; unfortunately, it had been a little dull and
he had decided not to finish it. He thumbed through the
rough pages of his magazine. Grotesque black and white
drawings decorated the pages. There were monsters and
ghouls, beautiful women (usually screaming) and lean young
men with pongee hats. The title ‚ÄúSatanic Underworld‚Äù appealed
to him and he started to read.</p>

<p>After only a few minutes, however, he found himself studying
the tile floor. Black and white tile in neat one-two-three
pattern across the floor; he liked things that were black or
white. The pattern was familiar to him and gave him a further
feeling of being home.</p>

<p>Great ideas came to Richard Kuppelton enthroned. Here
in this retreat the entire world assumed a pattern of great
simplicity. All problems could be rendered answerable and
in this world he was sovereign. The lavatory was his study.
He thought of Robert Holton: the person who currently
threatened his career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>Robert Holton was deceitful; he knew that. On the surface
he appeared simple and a little shy but Kuppelton knew differently.
Little things that the others had not noticed he
noticed. For instance, Holton was always trying to get
friendly with Mr Murphy. He always called him ‚Äúsir‚Äù;
treated him as if he were a colonel or something in the army.
That was another thing: the army. Holton had been a soldier
and Kuppelton had not. Most of the others in the office
had not been in the war either. Both Mr Heywood and Mr
Golden had declared that they would do all that they could
for the veteran. So far this hadn‚Äôt been very much, but still
it was their intention. Richard Kuppelton wished suddenly
that he could stay forever in this shiny black stall with the
tile floor.</p>

<p>There was a noise in the lavatory. Someone had come in.
Footsteps clattered on the floor. The door to the stall next
to his opened and someone sat down.</p>

<p>He wondered who it was. The person wore plain brown
shoes: he could see them through the foot-high space beneath
the stall partition. This person also wore brown trousers.
Richard Kuppelton thought for a moment, strained to
remember who it could be. Then he remembered.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHello, Bob,‚Äù said Richard Kuppelton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat? That you, Dick?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe same.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou catching up on your reading?‚Äù</p>

<p>Richard Kuppelton closed his magazine guiltily. ‚ÄúNo, no.
Just nature.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good place to think.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, I suppose it is.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with Caroline today?‚Äù asked Robert Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt the slightest idea. I didn‚Äôt notice anything
wrong with her, did you?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, I thought she was sort of irritable.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt notice it.‚Äù Richard Kuppelton sighed. He was
beginning to get uncomfortable, sitting on the hard seat. He
was, also, a little surprised that Holton was as aware of Caroline
as this. ‚ÄúCaroline‚Äôs a lot of fun,‚Äù he said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a lot of fun to go out on a party with. She can be
real funny.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI suppose so.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou ever go out with her?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI never went to a party with her. We had dinner once.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt want to go dancing?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs funny.‚Äù Richard Kuppelton tried to remember
whether he had ever taken Caroline out and they had not
danced. No, they had always gone to a dance. He wondered
whether she liked Robert Holton better than him. This was
a new thought and even more unpleasant than the suspicion
that Robert Holton was trying to get his job. ‚ÄúShe just likes
to talk?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, I guess everybody does.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, I guess.‚Äù Richard Kuppelton studied Holton‚Äôs
plain tan shoes gloomily. One of the things he could
not understand was why Robert Holton had come to work
in this office. It was rumored that he was a friend of Mr<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
Heywood‚Äôs but no one had ever been able to prove that. He
had gone to Harvard before the war and to Richard Kuppelton
that was the most important thing about him. It was
also suspicious; he could not understand why a person with
that education would do this job in Heywood and Golden
unless&mdash;and Richard Kuppelton became gloomier&mdash;unless he
were to be promoted over everyone.</p>

<p>‚ÄúLooks like there‚Äôll be a lot of changes after the first,‚Äù said
Kuppelton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThey tell me there usually are.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI suppose you want to end up in the other office, being
one of the contact people.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care much. Whatever they want to do. I‚Äôd like
to move up, of course.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe all would.‚Äù</p>

<p>Robert Holton mumbled something and stood up. Kuppelton
watched the tan shoes as they moved about the stall.
There was a swirling of water and Robert Holton left the
lavatory, whistling.</p>

<p>Richard Kuppelton studied the tile again. It seemed,
somehow, less comforting, less private since Holton had been
here. He tried to read again but ‚ÄúSatanic Underworld‚Äù
had lost its attraction. The seat was becoming harder every
minute and he would have to leave soon.</p>

<p>Then he remembered that the acoustics were unusually
good in this lavatory. In a low voice he sang an Irish ballad
which he had learned in school. His voice came to him pure
and vibrant and like no other voice that had ever sung. He
finished with a low note, although, strictly speaking, the ballad
called for a high note. He sang a popular song next. It was
not as great a success as the first because he only knew the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
chorus. The words that he made up, however, were quite
good enough.</p>

<p>At last, his songs finished, Richard Kuppelton stood up.
He ached slightly from the strain of sitting on the narrow
seat. Deliberately he arranged his trousers, deploring slightly
the heaviness of his waist as he did.</p>

<p>The sound of swirling water was in his ears as he crossed
the lavatory to the wash basin. Deliberately&mdash;he was a deliberate
person&mdash;he washed his hands. He dried his hands on
a paper towel and then, like a king abdicating, he moved
slowly but deliberately to the door. With a sigh Richard
Kuppelton left the lavatory.</p>

<p>The office had not changed. Mr Murphy was sitting behind
his railing, smoking a cigar and reading a letter. Caroline
was typing. Robert Holton was copying a row of figures
into his notebook. The other men and women in the office
were working busily.</p>

<p>Richard Kuppelton sat down at his desk. He enjoyed the
sensation of being a part of this great house. Neatly he arranged
his books of tables and statistics across the top of his
desk. The various books were open at aircraft stock. His
statistics would form the basis of a report which would be
used in an overall survey of aircraft stock to be used by the
front office. His responsibilities were heavy.</p>

<p>He took his fountain pen out of his pocket. It was leaking
a little and he had to handle it carefully. Slowly, with pleasure,
he copied the figures from the books. He wrote the numbers
carefully, making them round and legible. When he had
finished copying all his numbers they would be typed up by
one of the stenographers in the office.</p>

<p>A tall white-faced boy in a blue suit came into the room.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
He went to Richard Kuppelton's desk and put some papers
on it.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood morning, Jim,‚Äù said Kuppelton heartily. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the
boy?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúFine. I think Golden‚Äôs coming this way.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúReally? Wonder what he wants.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHard to say. He always wants something.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs his privilege,‚Äù said Kuppelton righteously.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI suppose so,‚Äù said Jim.</p>

<p>The white-faced boy went on to the next desk, handing
out letters and inter-office memoranda.</p>

<p>Richard Kuppelton put his fountain pen down carefully.
There were several letters for him. He opened one of them
and started to read.</p>

<p>He had read only a few lines when Mr Golden came into
the office. Even without looking up from his letter Richard
Kuppelton could have told that someone from the front office
had arrived. The typewriters clattered more loudly. The
usual low buzz of voices died away, and he could hear Mr
Murphy‚Äôs swivel chair being pushed back from his desk as
he stood up to welcome the visitor from the front office.
Kuppelton put his letter under the blotter and then he
looked up casually.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin Golden stood behind Mr Murphy‚Äôs
railing. He stood very erect, his eyes moving from desk to
desk as he studied the office. He was a short man and plump.
His eyes were small and black and shiny. Mr Golden had
iron-gray hair which he allowed to grow a little longer than
necessary. He was proud to have kept his hair. He had a
small nose and a rather foolish little mouth and he looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
more like a South American or Italian or something like that,
thought Kuppelton.</p>

<p>He pretended to write figures in his notebook, while he
listened carefully to what Mr Golden was saying to Mr
Murphy.</p>

<p>‚ÄúEverything all right here, Murphy?‚Äù Mr Golden had a
high thin voice.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, sir, we‚Äôre getting your reports out. I‚Äôll have the special
one for you this afternoon.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good. I really need that report. That‚Äôs an important
one. Some of our big steel clients are interested in it.
I know you‚Äôve done a good job on it.‚Äù There was almost a
threat in his voice. It was well known that the two did not
like each other.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôve got our best girl, I‚Äôve got Caroline here typing
it.‚Äù He waved at Caroline who looked up and smiled at Mr
Golden who smiled back at her. Richard Kuppelton wondered
what Mrs Golden was like.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll do a good job. How‚Äôs that aircraft stock
report coming?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúKuppelton‚Äôs doing it.‚Äù Mr Murphy pointed to him.</p>

<p>Mr Golden nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be interested to see it.‚Äù Richard
Kuppelton copied figures quickly.</p>

<p>‚ÄúShould be a good survey,‚Äù said Mr Murphy. ‚ÄúIs there
going to be a board meeting this morning? You said they
hadn‚Äôt decided earlier.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, yes, I almost forgot; there‚Äôll be a meeting at eleven-thirty.‚Äù
Mr Golden had an irritatingly brusque manner.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFine,‚Äù said Mr Murphy and he made a note of it on the
pad on his desk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>Mr Golden didn‚Äôt seem to want to go. He looked around
the room again. He looked at Robert Holton and said something
to Mr Murphy which Kuppelton couldn‚Äôt hear. Mr
Murphy smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>Mr Golden finally opened the door of the railing. ‚ÄúSee you
at the meeting, Murphy.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù</p>

<p>Mr Golden hurried out of the office. There was an immediate
change in the sounds of the room after he had left.
The hum of voices began again. Richard Kuppelton put
down his fountain pen.</p>

<p>Caroline and Mr Murphy were talking together and laughing.
Robert Holton was still working quietly at his desk.
The women of the office talked about Mr Golden in low
voices.</p>

<p>Richard Kuppelton wondered what Mr Golden had said
to Mr Murphy about Robert Holton. He looked at Robert
Holton with dislike.</p>

<p>‚ÄúO.K.,‚Äù said Kuppelton, ‚ÄúMr Golden‚Äôs gone, you can stop
working.‚Äù</p>

<p>Robert Holton put down his notebook and smiled. ‚ÄúIt
doesn‚Äôt hurt,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt hurt to look busy.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, no, I wasn‚Äôt meaning to criticize.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think you were. Did you hear what they were
talking about?‚Äù</p>

<p>This was malicious, Richard Kuppelton knew; it would
have been very hard for Holton not to have heard. ‚ÄúOh, they
were just talking about reports.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I guessed.‚Äù He started to work again.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou live uptown, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù remarked Kuppelton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes. I‚Äôve got a room in a hotel.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs funny, I thought you lived with your family or
something. I thought Caroline said something about it.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúMy father used to live here. He lives in Boston now. He
used to work here but he retired when I got out of the
army.‚Äù</p>

<p>Richard Kuppelton nodded. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, I remember
your telling me that once. Me, I live with all my family in
Queens. We all live there. I wish sometimes that I lived
alone.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not much fun, living alone,‚Äù said Robert Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThink you‚Äôll get married soon?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think <em>I</em> might,‚Äù said Richard Kuppelton weightily; he
had no one in mind, though; except possibly Caroline.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs a good idea if you‚Äôve got the right person,‚Äù
said Robert Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs very true.‚Äù They thought of this a moment. Each
thought of it seriously and each regarded it distantly. Richard
Kuppelton had no real desire to be married. He supposed
that Robert Holton felt the same.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI wonder,‚Äù said Kuppelton subtly, ‚Äúwhat the conference
is going to be about this afternoon. I wonder if it‚Äôs about
promotions in the departments.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt any idea.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSince the war, seniority doesn‚Äôt make much difference.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI thought it did.‚Äù</p>

<p>Kuppelton shook his head, convinced of Holton‚Äôs insincerity.
For weeks now everyone had discussed the new policy
and everyone had watched the veterans in the different
offices, especially Holton; it was expected that they would
all be promoted: in any event Holton would be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, it doesn‚Äôt make a bit of difference.‚Äù</p>

<p>Robert Holton smiled. He had small white teeth and an
agreeable smile which Kuppelton resented. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good
news for me. I haven‚Äôt been here very long you know.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, yes, I know,‚Äù and Kuppelton laughed loudly to show
that he was friendly and that it made no difference to him
who was promoted.</p>

<p>He glanced toward the windows. Mr Murphy caught his
eye and motioned to him. Quickly Richard Kuppelton got to
his feet and walked across the room to the railing. He was
careful not to let the gate slam when he came into Mr
Murphy‚Äôs presence.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, sir?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI just wanted to check with you on that aircraft stock
report. I just wanted to make sure it was coming along well.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve been working on it right along, Mr Murphy. They‚Äôll
start typing it up tomorrow.‚Äù</p>

<p>Murphy compressed his lips and nodded slowly. ‚ÄúMr
Golden was asking for it. I wanted to be sure, Dick.‚Äù</p>

<p>Kuppelton was suddenly glad that Mr Murphy had called
him by his first name. He did this only when he was well
pleased or when he wanted something.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been quite a job getting those things together but I
finally ... got them together.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI know how it is. How‚Äôs your family these days?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThey‚Äôre pretty well. My mother‚Äôs been better. Her legs
don‚Äôt bother her so much now.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good. Arthritis is pretty bad. I had a grandmother
who had it once.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty bad,‚Äù agreed Richard Kuppelton.</p>

<p>They both paused and wondered what to say next. Kuppelton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
began to edge toward the gate. Murphy stood up.
‚ÄúLet me see that thing as soon as you get it done.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI certainly will.‚Äù</p>

<p>Mr Murphy turned to Caroline who was typing at her
desk. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be in conference for a while,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúTake care of the calls, will you?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, Mr Murphy.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBig conference?‚Äù asked Kuppelton when Murphy had
gone.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù said Caroline and she stopped typing.
‚ÄúThey were talking about it. Something to do with policy,
I think.‚Äù</p>

<p>Caroline got up from her desk and stretched. She had nice
slim legs, Kuppelton noticed. He wondered if his mother
would like her. It was important to him to have his mother
like his future wife&mdash;if he ever had one. She had been wonderful
about the other girls he had liked but somehow they
had never been quite what she thought his wife should be.
He was her favorite son and he could not disappoint her,
naturally.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI guess that leaves me out,‚Äù he said wearily, hoping she
would give him some good news.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much,‚Äù she said, a little coldly
he thought, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got a good job now.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre right about that,‚Äù he said emphatically.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, I know I am. Bob‚Äôs the fair-haired boy these days,‚Äù
she added.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI expect he is.‚Äù</p>

<p>Caroline walked to the window and looked down at the
crowded street. ‚ÄúThere really are a lot of people in this
town,‚Äù she said in a distant voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúThere sure are.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúDo you ever wonder about all those people ... down
there?‚Äù</p>

<p>This was the sort of talk that made Richard Kuppelton
nervous. He hated it when people started asking him vague
questions to which there were no sensible answers. ‚ÄúNo, I
can‚Äôt say that I do.‚Äù</p>

<p>She turned around and looked at him then, looked at him
rather sadly, he thought. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got work to do,‚Äù was all she
said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSee you, Caroline.‚Äù</p>

<p>Robert Holton was leaning back in his chair.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPretty dull, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù commented Dick.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe army was a lot duller.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI thought that was one thing that it wasn‚Äôt ... dull.‚Äù</p>

<p>Robert Holton chuckled. ‚ÄúThis is a lot better.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you miss moving around?‚Äù</p>

<p>He paused before he replied and Kuppelton wondered
what the truth really was; however, Robert Holton only said,
‚ÄúNo, no, I like staying in one place.‚Äù</p>

<p>Richard Kuppelton turned back to his books of figures. He
wondered helplessly, as he wrote, how anyone could be as
deceitful as Robert Holton. It was obvious to him that Holton
would get the job he was to have gotten and he certainly
could not get this job without being deceitful. Richard Kuppelton
was worried about this. He was also worried because
he found himself hating Robert Holton and his mother would
never have approved of that.</p>

</div>


<p class="p2">The ulcer was the most important thing.</p>

<p>After the ulcer his wife, and then his job, and finally his
children. These were Mr Murphy‚Äôs interests. At the moment
the ulcer was more important to him than all the others
together.</p>

<p>Ever since Mr Murphy could remember, he had had pains
in his stomach. Not really bad pains: just unpleasant sensations.
In recent years this had gotten worse. A month before,
a doctor examined him and said that he had an ulcer. The
doctor was very serious and there was talk of further tests.
Then Mr Murphy read a picture magazine article on cancer.</p>

<p>He did not suspect cancer: he knew. The doctor, although
he had been rather grave, had said nothing about cancer, but
Mr Murphy was confident he had it. He had tried to do
everything right, to cure himself with bicarbonate of soda
and other medicines but the pains not only didn‚Äôt go away
but they got worse when he thought about them.</p>

<p>He pushed his fist into his stomach for a moment and felt
the pain under his fingers. He cursed himself for having gone
to the party the night before.</p>

<p>As he walked through his office he wished that he were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
home in bed. It would have been harder, of course, to stay
home, because his wife was not very good with an illness.
She had a tendency to become hysterical if she had to do
anything unusual. No, it was better to be here at the office.
To be here even if he was dying. This last thought made him
uncomfortable and he put it out of his mind.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch&mdash;eleven-fifteen. The meeting would
begin soon. Mr Golden insisted that all meetings begin on
time.</p>

<p>Mr Murphy left his office. As he walked through the
rooms he was pleased to have everyone speak to him politely.
He was a person of importance here and he had become this
all by himself with no help from anyone; practically no
help.</p>

<p>The executive offices were larger and better decorated
than the other offices. There were several uniform rooms
where the vice-presidents (they used to be partners but Mr
Golden had changed that) sat at big desks and received clients
and dictated letters and did other things. Then there
was the anteroom. This was a small room with red leather
couches, a receptionist, some modern lamps and two portraits
on the walls. These paintings were of Mr Heywood and
Mr Golden. Beyond the anteroom was the boardroom.</p>

<p>The receptionist smiled at Mr Murphy. He smiled back at
her and sat down in one of the red leather couches. Two
minor vice-presidents were also seated and waiting. They
greeted him soberly.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNice morning,‚Äù said the younger of the vice-presidents;
he had been a lieutenant commander in the navy.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCertainly is,‚Äù said Mr Murphy.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI understood we‚Äôre in for a cold winter,‚Äù commented the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
older of the two vice-presidents; he had been a commander
in the navy.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNothing like a real old-fashioned Christmas,‚Äù said Mr
Murphy in a smooth low voice. He was conscious of a difference
in their voices. His own voice sounded rough to him
while their voices were always smooth and almost British. He
had noticed these differences before but there was nothing
much he could do about them. In the front office he always
felt less important because of this difference, and because of
this and other things, too, he was made to feel an outsider.</p>

<p>The vice-presidents then talked in their cultured near-British
voices about a certain college football game. Mr
Murphy lay back in his red couch and wondered if perhaps
he should drink more milk. That was good for ulcers; but
nothing was good for cancer. He shuddered.</p>

<p>A few more vice-presidents and section heads came into
the anteroom. They talked and laughed together and Oliver
L. Murphy talked and laughed with them.</p>

<p>There was a buzz and everyone stopped talking. The receptionist
looked up from her desk. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre ready,‚Äù she
said.</p>

<p>The men walked into the boardroom of Heywood and
Golden.</p>

<p>A long room, with indirect lighting, thick carpets, and a
long table with armchairs around it: this was the boardroom.
On the walls were charts of stocks and trends.</p>

<p>Mr Heywood was sitting at one end of the table and Mr
Golden was sitting at the other end of the table. Murphy
sat down on the left of Mr Heywood. This was his usual
seat.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHello, Oliver,‚Äù said Mr Heywood cheerily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúHello, Mr Heywood.‚Äù Murphy was suddenly glad, glad
that Mr Heywood had called him by his first name; he did
this only when he was well-pleased, or wanted something.</p>

<p>Oliver L. Murphy leaned back in his leather armchair. Mr
Heywood sat rather limply in his own chair at the head of
the table. He waited for the others to be seated.</p>

<p>Lawrence Heywood was a gentleman. He had a large
estate in Maryland and he collected prints; he had had three
wives and a number of children and, generally, he had managed
to do everything in a large but tasteful manner.</p>

<p>He was a tall man in his late forties. Completely bald, his
neat round head shone pinkly under the indirect lights. His
face was smooth and neat and looked as if he had never worried
in his life. His voice was not near-British like his vice-presidents:
it was British. He had gone to school in Massachusetts
which explained a lot of it, thought Murphy.</p>

<p>Mr Heywood did everything properly. He had inherited
a lot of money. It seemed as if every year a new relative
would die and leave more money to him. His three wives had
all been beautiful and that was another thing to be said for
him&mdash;he knew how to choose women. Mr Murphy wondered
what it would be like to marry a beautiful woman.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow‚Äôs that new man in your office?‚Äù asked Mr Heywood
suddenly.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou mean Holton? He‚Äôs doing very well.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to hear it. We have a mutual friend,‚Äù and Mr
Heywood laughed gently at the thought.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIs that right? He‚Äôs got a good background, I guess,‚Äù said
Murphy.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI expect so. I used to know his mother. She was a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
attractive woman twenty years ago. She married...‚Äù Mr
Heywood decided not to reminisce in front of Murphy.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs worked in my section, in the office, just fine.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good. I don‚Äôt know him myself but I have some
plans for him. We‚Äôre going to the same party tonight.‚Äù Mr
Heywood laughed gently again. ‚ÄúPerhaps we‚Äôll get to know
each other. It‚Äôs so hard ever getting to know employees in
the office,‚Äù sighed Mr Heywood. ‚ÄúI rather wish there weren‚Äôt
so many of them sometimes.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI know just how it is.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe going to call this meeting together?‚Äù It was Mr
Golden‚Äôs high voice from the other end of the table.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCertainly, Ben,‚Äù said Mr Heywood. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll start right
now.‚Äù He picked up a black ebony gavel and tapped lightly,
apologetically with it. The men stopped talking. ‚ÄúNow, let‚Äôs
see,‚Äù began Mr Heywood.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Steel account, that‚Äôs the big thing we‚Äôre going to talk
about,‚Äù said Mr Golden.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right.‚Äù Mr Heywood sounded bored. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right.
Well, gentlemen, it seems that we have a problem.‚Äù</p>

<p>Mr Murphy relaxed in his chair. Mr Heywood‚Äôs voice,
gentle and cultured, came to him soothingly. The Steel account
was of no interest to Mr Murphy; in fact, these conferences
were generally of no interest to him. He was just there
to talk about Statistics.</p>

<p>He played with papers in front of him. The voice of Mr
Heywood flowed about him. He was lost in a slow current
of polite vowels. The pain in his stomach was, for the time,
gone.</p>

<p>Mr Heywood spoke of the market, of stocks and shares,
of the state of the Union. He spoke convincingly because his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
manner was convincing and, also, because his ideas and
facts had been given him by many clever men.</p>

<p>Mr Golden sat at his end of the table and listened. He sat
there very straight, his little mouth set in a soft line of
pseudo-firmness. His small hands drummed on the table and
his eyes glanced about the room. His eyes were always in
motion. The fear of a thousand years was in Mr Golden‚Äôs
eyes.</p>

<p>From time to time he interrupted. Mr Heywood would
pause and listen; then, when the other had finished, he
would continue in his gentle voice to tell the others what
clever men had told him about Steel, and the men, whose
livings depended upon him, listened respectfully to their
ideas.</p>

<p>Mr Murphy observed these things as he sat in his chair.
He felt less important in these conferences but he did feel
secure. Here in the boardroom he felt himself to be a part
of something large and opulent&mdash;of American Business. This
thought was comforting as well as sobering. There was no
security in the world to equal that of belonging. It made no
difference to what one belonged just as long as one was a
part of something big and secure. And what, Oliver Murphy
asked himself, could be bigger or more secure than Business?
He saw these things clearly because he had a philosopher‚Äôs
mind and the Celt‚Äôs ability to envisage life in a clear perspective.
He could, he knew, see the trees as well as the forest.
That was what made him different from the others. They
felt, perhaps, that they belonged, but he <em>knew</em>.</p>

<p>Then the ulcer began to bother him.</p>

<p>He no longer was conscious of Mr Heywood‚Äôs voice. The
only thing of importance now was the dull pain in his stomach.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
He moved uneasily in his chair. He pushed a hand into
his stomach. This helped a little. The pain shifted slightly.
He followed it with his hand, his fingers pressing gently into
the pain.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll want complete figures on the rise and fall of Arizona
Zinc during the past five years.‚Äù</p>

<p>This was said by Mr Heywood. It registered in Mr
Murphy‚Äôs mind but he didn‚Äôt respond for a moment.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have those figures for us next meeting, won‚Äôt you?‚Äù
Heywood asked, irritation in his voice.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCertainly, Mr Heywood,‚Äù said Murphy. He sat up straight
and Mr Heywood nodded to him and then continued to talk.</p>

<p>Oliver Murphy listened carefully to everything said. He
was beginning to sweat from the pain and the fear (more
fear than pain, he told himself) but still he strained to hear
every word and, slowly, as he listened, magic took place and
the pain went away.</p>

<p>At last, when certain decisions had been made, Mr Heywood
adjourned the meeting.</p>

<p>Murphy stood up. He felt better now. He wondered if perhaps
he might not be mistaken about the cancer.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, Murphy.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, Mr Heywood?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat fellow in your office, that Holton, you think he‚Äôs
quite efficient?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI do.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI wonder,‚Äù said Mr Heywood hesitantly, ‚ÄúI wonder how
he might work out as one of our customers‚Äô men. Dealing
with the public, all that sort of thing.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôd probably do that very well.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou could afford to lose him?‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, yes, I think so.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI wish,‚Äù said Mr Heywood petulantly, ‚Äúthat I knew him
better. It‚Äôs terrible having so little contact with the office
people.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI could send him in to see you.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood Lord, no! I wouldn‚Äôt know what to say. I‚Äôll wait
and see him tonight at Mrs Stevanson‚Äôs.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhen do you think you‚Äôll change him over?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt know. If I think he has the suitable, ah, temperament,
we might change him this week.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI know he‚Äôll be really tickled to hear this.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI expect so.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow is Mrs Heywood?‚Äù asked Murphy politely.</p>

<p>‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fine, thank you,‚Äù said Mr Heywood blankly. Trouble,
decided Murphy. The third Mrs Heywood seemed to be following
the previous Mrs Heywoods.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell...‚Äù said Murphy and he mumbled words to himself
as he walked toward the door. Mr Heywood stared
vacantly at him as he left.</p>

<p>Mr Murphy felt well when he was in motion. Walking
with great dignity from office to office, conscious of the eyes
of others upon him, was good for him. Aware of being a symbol
of success he forgot his pains and some of his worries.</p>

<p>As he went into the Statistical office he could feel the atmosphere
change. The clerks and typists became busy.</p>

<p>Mr Murphy went to his desk. ‚ÄúAny calls?‚Äù he asked.</p>

<p>Caroline shook her head. When she shook, her breasts
quivered slightly. Mr Murphy noticed this and his stomach
constricted with pain. Emotion was bad for him, according
to the doctors. He looked away and tried to think of something
else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, there weren‚Äôt any calls. Some memorandums came
in from the other sections but that was all.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAny letters?‚Äù He thought of his family.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Caroline sounded surprised. ‚ÄúRight there on your
desk. Right where I always put them.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, yes.‚Äù Mr Murphy sat down at his desk and looked at
the pile of neat businesslike envelopes. He had no desire to
open them.</p>

<p>Caroline typed rhythmically at her desk.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSay, Caroline....‚Äù</p>

<p>She stopped and looked at him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTell Holton to step over here, will you?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSure, Mr Murphy.‚Äù She got up and went through the gate
and out into the office. He watched her legs as she walked
determinedly to the other end of the room. He was almost
pleased to feel the pain come flooding into his stomach. That
would teach his stomach, he thought viciously.</p>

<p>The gate creaked and Robert Holton stood before him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou want to see me, sir?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, yes, Holton. Sit down here. Over here on my left.‚Äù</p>

<p>Robert Holton sat down and looked expectant. Mr
Murphy wondered for a moment why he had asked to see
Holton. Then he remembered what Mr Heywood had said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow‚Äôs everything coming, Holton?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúJust fine, Mr Murphy.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs good. Things <em>have</em> been going pretty well
here. But I suppose you find things pretty dull after the
army?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, no. I like this sort of work. I had enough moving
around.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI should think so. Well, that‚Äôs what most of us want, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
guess,‚Äù said Mr Murphy. ‚ÄúWe want to settle down. A lot of
people say they don‚Äôt like routine but I think everybody
does. It‚Äôs an important thing.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, sir. I think it is.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThere is,‚Äù said Mr Murphy, shutting his eyes for a moment
to give the illusion of pondering, ‚Äúthere is security in
working for a big house like Heywood and Golden.‚Äù He
opened his eyes and looked directly at Holton. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you
feel that‚Äôs true?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, I hope so.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs true.‚Äù Mr Murphy sighed and thought about going
out to the country for a rest. A place that would have
neither telephones nor mosquitoes. Most places had one or
the other.</p>

<p>He looked at Robert Holton and wondered what he was
thinking. He seemed a likeable young man. He was quiet
and reserved and didn‚Äôt seem too aggressive. In fact that was
probably a fault that Mr Murphy had not thought of. Holton
was not a go-getter. He might lack initiative. That was
why he was quiet and reserved. Or, as Mr Murphy finally
thought, that might be a reason for his reserve.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTell me, Holton,‚Äù said Murphy, ‚Äúhave you had any ideas
about, ah, your place here? I mean, what you would like to
do. Naturally you wouldn‚Äôt be interested in staying here, in
this department. With your education....‚Äù He permitted
his voice to fade.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, I haven‚Äôt had any ideas; in fact, I haven‚Äôt thought
too much about it. You see this is all pretty different from
what it was like where I was in the army. I don‚Äôt suppose
I‚Äôm quite used to the idea ... well, you know....‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúI think I do. You would like to work in another department
perhaps?‚Äù</p>

<p>Robert Holton looked at him. Mr Murphy could not tell
what he was thinking for his face was relaxed and calm.
‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said Holton, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt want to be out
of my depth. I‚Äôd like to make more money. I like the idea of
buying and selling stocks. I like that idea very much. In fact,
that‚Äôs one of the reasons I came here.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOf course, there‚Äôs a lot of work to knowing about stocks
and bonds. You realize all the work that‚Äôs involved.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúPerhaps a place will be found for you in that department.
It‚Äôs hard to say, though. With your, ah, background it
shouldn‚Äôt be too hard. That is, if you have the <em>stuff</em>.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI hope so.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood.‚Äù Mr Murphy watched Caroline typing. ‚ÄúI understand,‚Äù
said Mr Murphy finally in a changed voice, ‚Äúthat
you‚Äôre going out tonight.‚Äù</p>

<p>Robert Holton looked surprised. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúMr Heywood said you and he were going to the same
party.‚Äù</p>

<p>Holton smiled. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, I‚Äôd forgotten. Mrs Stevanson‚Äôs
giving a cocktail party. I guess that‚Äôs what he means.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt hurt to be nice to him there,‚Äù said Mr Murphy
with a laugh.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt suppose so.‚Äù</p>

<p>Mr Murphy looked at Holton and wondered what would
become of him. If he had more initiative he might be a
wealthy man because of his background (the important
thing was background), but he would probably not go very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
far. He might not even go as far as Mr Murphy had and Mr
Murphy had been a success without background. Robert
Holton didn‚Äôt look as though he cared to be a success.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, don‚Äôt let your night life interfere with business,‚Äù
said Mr Murphy lightly.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Holton rising, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>

<p>With a nod Mr Murphy dismissed him.</p>

<p>Mr Murphy watched Caroline absently as she typed. Her
hair was rather long. It must be a nuisance to help her into
a coat, he thought suddenly. That was something he hated
to do. Whenever he helped a woman into a coat there was,
first, a certain struggle to get her arms into the sleeves. Some
women were better than others at this. And then, second,
there was the problem of hair. If the woman had long hair
it was inevitably caught inside the coat. This meant that her
first motion was usually to free her hair and that involved a
wild freeing and flinging of the hair which for anyone still
posted behind her meant running a risk of becoming entangled.
Mr Murphy wondered about these problems as he
looked at Caroline‚Äôs long dark hair.</p>

<p>He had started to work on his letters (the ones in the
business envelopes) when Richard Kuppelton appeared.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve got the first part of that report here, the one on aircraft,‚Äù
said Kuppelton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes?‚Äù Mr Murphy made himself sound cold and official.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, I wondered if you cared to look at them ... what
I‚Äôve done so far, I mean.‚Äù</p>

<p>Mr Murphy looked at him for a moment without speaking.
When Mr Murphy had first come to work for Heywood
and Golden his then immediate boss had impressed him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
greatly by just looking at him for several seconds at a time
without speaking. Mr Murphy had adopted the mannerism
and over the years had improved it until now he could be
very frightening. He was that way now.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou want me to do it for you?‚Äù he asked finally.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo ... no, sir, I didn‚Äôt mean that. I just thought you
would like to see what I got done.‚Äù Kuppelton was uncomfortable
and Mr Murphy decided that he had done enough.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy, I‚Äôd be glad to look at it,‚Äù he said.</p>

<p>Kuppelton brightened. ‚ÄúThank you. I only wanted you to
see the form I was using here. That was all. I‚Äôm making my
conclusions in a slightly different way from usual and I
thought....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôll take a look at it.‚Äù</p>

<p>Kuppelton put a pile of papers down on Mr Murphy‚Äôs
desk.</p>

<p>Mr Murphy nodded at him and Kuppelton left quickly.
Mr Murphy felt much better after exercising his power. Poor
Kuppelton was a good man in an office but he would never
go very far because he didn‚Äôt have assurance. He would be
promoted after the first of the year if Holton were moved
out. That would make Kuppelton happy, which was a
good thing. It wasn‚Äôt bad, thought Mr Murphy, to have contented
people about you in a discontented world. He relaxed
in his chair and then the pains started again.</p>

<p>This time the ache was about an inch below his belt and
slightly toward the left (his appendix was on the right and,
besides, his appendix was in good shape). The pain began to
move toward the center. Quickly he pressed his fingers into
the pain.</p>

<p>His heart beat rapidly and sweat formed on his face. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
the pain didn‚Äôt go away by the count of ten he would get
up and take the special medicine his doctor had given him.</p>

<p>Frightened, Mr Murphy counted and the pain, not subject
to this magic, did not go away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><em>Chapter Six</em></h2>
</div>


<p class="p2">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs twelve o‚Äôclock,‚Äù Caroline said to Mr Murphy. ‚ÄúI
think I‚Äôll go out to lunch, if that‚Äôs O.K.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, yes, Caroline.‚Äù</p>

<p>She thought he looked rather pale. She was about to ask
him how he felt but she stopped herself, remembering how
he disliked talking about his health. She had noticed that
during the last year he had been taking a lot of medicine.
Perhaps he was going to die. Caroline began to compose a
little drama to herself. Mr Murphy had just collapsed across
his desk and she had been the only one to keep a clear
head....</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou coming, Caroline?‚Äù It was Robert Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBe right there.‚Äù She arranged the papers on her desk,
shut the drawers and joined Robert Holton outside the gate
of the railing.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhere‚Äôll we eat today?‚Äù asked Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAt <em>the</em> restaurant, of course. Where did you think we
would?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù He was smiling now and she wondered
if he could have been trying to be funny; she could
never be sure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúSometimes you don‚Äôt make sense,‚Äù said Caroline.</p>

<p>They were almost through the door when one of the secretaries
called to Holton. ‚ÄúPhone, Bob.‚Äù</p>

<p>She waited for him at the door. He went over to his desk
and answered the phone. He seemed excited, she noticed,
and he talked very quickly. She wished she could hear what
he was saying. Finally, he finished and joined her.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWho was that?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAn old friend of mine.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúMan or woman?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúA guy I used to know. He just got in town. He comes
from out West and I haven‚Äôt seen him for a couple of years.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou knew him in the army?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>

<p>They walked through the offices to the elevator and Holton
pressed the button.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs he doing in town?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just visiting. I‚Äôm going to see him this afternoon.
He‚Äôs coming over here after lunch.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôll be nice. What does he look like?‚Äù She asked this
gaily, hoping to have some effect on him. She didn‚Äôt, though.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. He looks all right, I guess.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou certainly are good at description. Be sure to let me
meet him.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI will.‚Äù</p>

<p>The elevator stopped for them and they pushed into the
lunch-going crowd. With a rush they descended to the street
floor.</p>

<p>Outside the sun shone brightly above the street. The sky
was a vivid blue and the air smelt clean in spite of the exhaust
fumes and the people of the city. The day was warm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>They walked along the crowded street. Men of affairs
with brief cases walked in and out of swinging glass doors.
Younger men of affairs, wearing bowler hats and dark coats
with darker velvet lapels, marched solemnly in the parade
of business. The white-faced clerks squinted at the bright
sun. Women secretaries walked together, admiring themselves
in the windows. As they walked they talked to each
other and to themselves.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat a nice day,‚Äù said Caroline, breathing deeply and
coughing as the exhaust fumes tickled her throat.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMust be nice in the country,‚Äù commented Robert Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNot you too?‚Äù Caroline laughed. ‚ÄúFirst Murphy and now
you want to go out in the country.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go. I just said it must be pleasant there.‚Äù
They crossed a street and he looked carefully to left and
right and when they finally crossed the street the crowd had
gone around them and the light was beginning to change
again.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy do you take so long?‚Äù said Caroline disagreeably.</p>

<p>‚ÄúJust careful, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù</p>

<p>They walked in silence then. She was very conscious of
his being beside her, of her arm being in his. This troubled
Caroline, this awareness. She looked at Holton‚Äôs face as they
walked down the crowded street. There was nothing in his
face that she would like to have seen. This made her feel
better because he was not the right person.</p>

<p>Over the high gray buildings was a narrow section of
bright blue sky. It was almost too bright and contrasted
strangely with the dingy buildings and the dark streets. Caroline
watched the blue sky suspended upon the buildings. No
clouds were in the sky but from time to time a bird would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
circle in it. And, as she watched the sky, a large air liner,
like a rigid bird, moved straightly eastward.</p>

<p>Caroline breathed deeply again, careful this time not to
get the exhaust fumes too far down in her lungs. She coughed
anyway.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Marjorie Ventusa looked through the plate-glass window
at the street. She had been watching off and on for half an
hour, waiting for Robert Holton to come.</p>

<p>Some days he would come in at twelve and other days at
twelve-thirty, and then there had been certain days when
he‚Äôd not come in at all and those were bad days for Marjorie
Ventusa.</p>

<p>It was a few minutes after twelve when she saw him walking
down the street, pushing through the crowd, a man different
from all the others walking in the street. She frowned
when she saw the pretty secretary with him. Marjorie hated
this girl but she was helpless and could only hate all the
others who seemed close to Robert Holton.</p>

<p>She pretended to be busy cleaning a table when they
came in.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHello, Marjorie,‚Äù said Holton and he and Caroline came
over to her table.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, hello, it‚Äôs you again.‚Äù She made herself sound matter-of-fact
and bored, but her throat was suddenly full and she
had to clear it before she could speak again. ‚ÄúWhat you going
to eat today?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù said Holton and he and Caroline sat down
at the table, across from each other. ‚ÄúWhat do you want,
Caroline?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to see a menu, I think,‚Äù said Caroline in a voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
that Marjorie Ventusa would like to have choked out of her.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHere,‚Äù said Marjorie and she handed them two white
menus.</p>

<p>They studied the menus.</p>

<p>Many people were coming in and going out of the restaurant.
All the tables were full now and there were people
standing and waiting for tables. Some of her customers were
beginning to look at her, waiting for her to take their order.
She hoped Mrs Merrin would not notice how long she was
taking with Robert Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think,‚Äù said Caroline, frowning a thin hair-wide frown,
‚ÄúI think I will have some tomato juice, and a lamb chop....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo more lamb chops,‚Äù said Marjorie, trying to keep the
triumph from her voice.</p>

<p>The hair-wide frown became a scowl. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll have the
veal.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAny vegetables?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, the spinach.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou can have one other.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all.‚Äù</p>

<p>And Marjorie thought, ‚Äúthe‚Äù spinach indeed. Why was it
that when these people wanted to sound elegant they would
talk about everything as ‚Äúthe‚Äù?</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat do you want, Mr Holton?‚Äù She wished that she
had the nerve to call him Bob, the right to call him that.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, I think I‚Äôll take the same.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúCoffee, tea, or milk?‚Äù She said the words as though they
were one word.</p>

<p>They both asked for coffee and Marjorie went quickly out
of the dining room and into the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>There was much more steam in the kitchen now than
there had been at breakfast; as the day passed the kitchen
got hotter, and steamier, and the cooks got more irritable
and Mrs Merrin more nervous and Marjorie Ventusa would
become tired and sad.</p>

<p>She called the new orders to the cook. Then she picked up
two small glasses of tomato juice and put them on her tray.
She fingered one of them a moment, thinking that soon he
would be drinking from it. She enjoyed thinking of this,
though it only made her desire stronger and her sadness
greater.</p>

<p>She didn‚Äôt want to go back yet. She hoped Mrs Merrin
would not come into the kitchen for a while.</p>

<p>But one of the swinging doors opened and Mrs Merrin
walked into the kitchen. Quickly Marjorie picked up her tray
and went back to the dining room.</p>

<p>Caroline and Robert Holton were talking seriously and
Marjorie, because of the noise of voices in the dining room,
couldn‚Äôt hear what they were saying.</p>

<p>They stopped talking as she came up to them.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHere you are,‚Äù said Marjorie Ventusa brightly, putting
the glasses of tomato juice on the table.</p>

<p>Robert Holton smiled at her, showing his white even teeth.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHave you got a date for tonight?‚Äù asked Robert Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou know I always do.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúA sailor maybe?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúGet one who‚Äôll take you to Italy.‚Äù</p>

<p>This was cruel but Marjorie smiled and forgave him. She
had not been joking when they spoke of Italy. She did not
think it fair of him to say this in front of the pretty girl, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
Marjorie forgave him because he was young and because she
felt about him in a certain way.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôll go to Capri together,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIs it nice
there?‚Äù</p>

<p>Holton nodded. ‚ÄúBeautiful.‚Äù</p>

<p>Caroline said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt want to take up any
more of her time, Bob. She‚Äôs got a lot of things to do.‚Äù Caroline
gave Marjorie a brilliant smile. A man from the table
next to theirs said loudly, ‚ÄúWhen are you bringing me my
soup?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIn just a minute, sir.‚Äù Marjorie looked at Robert Holton
once again, tried to catch his eye but he was talking now to
Caroline and Marjorie Ventusa had been put quietly from
his mind. She went back to the kitchen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Outside the restaurant Richard Kuppelton and the receptionist
Ruth were wondering whether anybody they knew
would be in the restaurant; otherwise they would have to
wait for a table.</p>

<p>Kuppelton looked through the window. He blinked nearsightedly.
Then he saw Robert Holton and Caroline.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCaroline‚Äôs in there,‚Äù he said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWith Bob?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, let‚Äôs go on in.‚Äù Ruth liked Robert Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHello, hello,‚Äù said Kuppelton heartily when they were
inside.</p>

<p>Caroline and Robert Holton appeared glad to see them.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMy gracious, it certainly is crowded,‚Äù said Ruth, pointing
to the people standing.</p>

<p>‚ÄúLucky you people were here,‚Äù said Kuppelton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt,‚Äù said Ruth, ‚Äúsee how the town stays so crowded
all the time. I could understand it during the war but now
... well, it‚Äôs just impossible to go anywhere or do anything.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI know,‚Äù said Holton. ‚ÄúTook me months to get a room.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIs it nice?‚Äù asked Caroline.</p>

<p>He shook his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very depressing.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôm lucky to be living with my family,‚Äù said Kuppelton.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs real nice out where we are and there aren‚Äôt so
many people. I‚Äôd hate to have to live in the city.‚Äù</p>

<p>They talked of the places where they lived and then they
started to talk of the places where they would like to live.</p>

<p>Kuppelton watched Holton as he talked and he tried to
learn, by concentrating intensely, what he was thinking; to
learn if Mr Murphy had said he would promote him. Holton‚Äôs
smooth forehead, however, was a wall and Kuppelton
could not pierce it, could not discover the dreams behind it.</p>

<p>Marjorie came over to their table and put two plates of
veal in front of Caroline and Robert. The veal was a uniform
tan color, floating in a sea of red sauce. Two saucers of dark-green
spinach floating in water were put beside the plates
of veal.</p>

<p>‚ÄúLooks good, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù commented Marjorie.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSure, sure,‚Äù said Holton, looking at his plate with distaste.</p>

<p>Kuppelton ordered veal and Marjorie left.</p>

<p>Kuppelton looked at Ruth. She was dark, with a big nose
and with self-pitying eyes. Her complexion was oily and she
wore too much make-up. Ruth liked all men; she was sitting
very close to Robert Holton now.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAny interesting people come into the office?‚Äù asked Holton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
turning to Ruth: as receptionist she was always able to
tell them about celebrities.</p>

<p>Ruth nodded. ‚ÄúLaura Whitner was in to see Mr Heywood.‚Äù</p>

<p>Caroline was interested. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the movie star, isn‚Äôt she?‚Äù</p>

<p>Ruth nodded again, a birdlike motion. ‚ÄúWhy, she used to
be one of the biggest stars. I used to go see all her pictures.
My gracious, they were wonderful.‚Äù</p>

<p>Marjorie Ventusa returned with veal for Kuppelton and
the ham and eggs for Ruth.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, thank you,‚Äù said Ruth. ‚ÄúI love ham,‚Äù she added.</p>

<p>Richard Kuppelton looked at Ruth with disapproval. She
was an aggressive woman and he was tired of aggressive
women. His mother was that way. Caroline was more what
he wanted. She had spirit but was not aggressive. There was
a difference between spirit and aggressiveness. He could not
quite define it but still there was a difference. Caroline could
act irritated with him and he would not mind. And she always
smiled, even when she was angry; he could not feel
that a woman who always smiled was aggressive. She had a
mind of her own but then he could handle that. Eating veal,
Richard Kuppelton felt he could handle anything.</p>

<p>Robert Holton finished eating. He sat back in his chair
and yawned.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBored?‚Äù asked Caroline.</p>

<p>He shook his head. ‚ÄúNo, not very. Just sleepy.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, I like that!‚Äù exclaimed Ruth. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd think we weren‚Äôt
good enough for him.‚Äù She said this in a way to let him
know she was being humorous.</p>

<p>Kuppelton decided, however, to develop what she‚Äôd said.
‚ÄúSure, he‚Äôs a good friend of Mr Heywood.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>Ruth was impressed. ‚ÄúI certainly wish I had your contacts
then. I sure wouldn‚Äôt be working in this lousy job.‚Äù</p>

<p>Robert Holton wanted to know what was wrong with her
job.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, you know how it is. Doing the same thing day after
day. It makes me sick. I‚Äôd like to do something exciting.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù asked Richard Kuppelton. These were his
secret wishes, too, but he would never have put them into
words. He was delighted to hear someone else say them.</p>

<p>Ruth was not sure just what she wanted. She decided she
would like to travel. Richard Kuppelton admitted, then, that
he would like to travel. Caroline thought a moment and
agreed with them that to travel would be the best thing
anyone could do, the thing she wanted to do.</p>

<p>Robert Holton, who had traveled, said that he didn‚Äôt care
to leave New York again: not for many years at least.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not adventurous,‚Äù said Caroline sadly.</p>

<p>Ruth protected him. ‚ÄúAfter all, he‚Äôs had some adventures.
He was in the war.‚Äù</p>

<p>Richard Kuppelton was glad that Holton did not talk
about the war. It made too great a difference between them
and the women might have called attention to this difference.</p>

<p>He disliked Robert Holton because he was afraid of him.
It was more than the threat to his job, much more than that.
Caroline, whom Kuppelton wanted, seemed interested in
him. He flattered himself that she was no more interested in
Holton than she was in himself; still he was a threat.</p>

<p>Ruth was moving closer to Robert Holton now. Her thick
curved lips, heavily painted a dark red, looked unpleasantly
moist. Kuppelton had a desire to dry her mouth. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
amused, though, at the way she was playing up to Holton.
She liked him now because of his influence, not because he
was good-looking. Although Kuppelton, for one, couldn‚Äôt see
his handsomeness. Holton was well-built but not much better
than he was; of course, Kuppelton had a slight stomach
and Holton didn‚Äôt, but a few days of exercise and he could
be as slim. He made a mental note to do some exercise.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Marjorie Ventusa arranged her hair in front of the steamy
mirror. It didn‚Äôt look too bad when she wore it over her ears.
She pinned it back carefully. Perhaps she wouldn‚Äôt have to
get a snood after all.</p>

<p>She put some other people‚Äôs orders on her tray and left the
kitchen. The crowd waiting to be seated was beginning to
thin and soon the lunch rush would be over.</p>

<p>She waited on the customers whose orders she had and
then she moved over to the table where Robert Holton was
sitting. He was very handsome, she thought. She looked at
the others with him and she envied them all. They didn‚Äôt
understand what he was, how important he was.</p>

<p>The girl with the blue eyes and slim legs she could not
like. This was her rival&mdash;one of her rivals, anyway. She was
glad that he never seemed particularly interested in this girl
and, for that matter, the girl didn‚Äôt seem interested in him.
Still she was near, worked with him probably: she was a
danger.</p>

<p>Then Marjorie Ventusa did not like the dark-haired girl
with the big nose who sat so close to him, but at least she
was not a danger. She almost pitied this girl who had moved
her chair so close to his that their legs were touching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>The other man was dull-looking and obviously interested
in the girl with the blue eyes. Marjorie Ventusa wished him
luck. Then, having thought these things about her customers,
she walked over to their table.</p>

<p>‚ÄúReady for dessert?‚Äù asked Marjorie Ventusa cheerfully,
trying not to look at Robert Holton.</p>

<p>They were ready.</p>

<p>Everyone decided to have vanilla ice cream. Slowly she
cleared the table. This was a hard thing to do, because she
had to act as if she were in a hurry.</p>

<p>They talked at the table as though she weren‚Äôt there. She
was, naturally, used to that: she had been a waitress a long
time, but today she was almost angry at being treated like
a piece of furniture. She could do nothing about it, though.
She picked up her tray and went into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Marjorie ordered the ice cream. As she waited she wondered
if there was any way she could ever see Robert Holton
in his other life: the mysterious important life he had in the
brokerage firm. She tried to think of some way she could get
to know him in this other life. She could think of nothing.</p>

<p>The ice cream was ready and she took it back to the dining
room.</p>

<p>She gave them their dessert and only Holton said thank
you. She tried to expand this one phrase into a conversation
but it was too difficult. So she walked over to the next table
which was now empty. Slowly she placed dishes on her tray.
She was near enough to them to hear what they were saying.</p>

<p>Robert Holton was talking about his job: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind
being in an office all day. I can‚Äôt see why people mind that
so much.‚Äù</p>

<p>The dark girl with the big nose disagreed: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
more natural to be able to wander around like you want to
do. It‚Äôs natural to travel, I think.‚Äù</p>

<p>He laughed. Marjorie liked his laugh. He said, ‚ÄúYou should
get married, that‚Äôs what you should do.‚Äù</p>

<p>The dark girl became coquettish. ‚ÄúBut I haven‚Äôt had any
offers yet. Of course, I‚Äôm open to any.‚Äù</p>

<p>The bitch, thought Marjorie Ventusa, disliking her now.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have any trouble,‚Äù said Holton gallantly
and Marjorie liked him for saying this.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just saying that.‚Äù</p>

<p>Then the girl with the blue eyes and the dull man began
to talk together and their voices blended into the ocean-like
sound of many voices in the restaurant.</p>

<p>They finished the ice cream.</p>

<p>Marjorie walked over to the table. ‚ÄúWill there be anything
else?‚Äù she asked officially.</p>

<p>There was nothing else.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have our check, please, Marjorie,‚Äù said Robert Holton
and she liked the way he said her name.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCertainly.‚Äù She went to the cashier and had the four
checks totalled. Then she came back.</p>

<p>They paid her.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBack to work,‚Äù said the blue-eyed girl with a sigh.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><em>Chapter Seven</em></h2>
</div>


<p class="p2">‚ÄúHere we are,‚Äù said Caroline.</p>

<p>Ruth went to her desk in the reception room. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you
all later,‚Äù she said and she sat down and took out a large
gold compact. Caroline watched her a moment as she powdered
her nose, watched her with a certain pity because she
was ugly.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù said Kuppelton and he and Robert Holton
walked on either side of her through the office. She was conscious
of the envious stares of the other girls and she smiled
at them as nicely as she could, knowing that they hated her
for her smile.</p>

<p>Mr Murphy was not in the Statistical office. Everyone else
was back, though. As she entered the room Caroline was
conscious of a difference in the atmosphere. The women
were quieter than usual and the men were watching. She
looked and saw, sitting at Holton‚Äôs desk, an army officer.</p>

<p>‚ÄúJim!‚Äù said Holton when he saw him; the other looked up.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHi,‚Äù he said and he got to his feet. They shook hands
with Anglo-Saxon restraint, muttering monosyllables of greeting,
each asking about the other‚Äôs health.</p>

<p>Kuppelton went to his own desk without speaking to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
army officer. Caroline stood expectantly beside Robert Holton,
waiting to be introduced.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis,‚Äù said Holton finally, ‚Äúis Caroline. Caroline, meet
Jim Trebling.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow do you do,‚Äù said Trebling.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow do you do,‚Äù said Caroline and they shook hands.
His hand, she noticed, was rough and hard.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou live in New York?‚Äù asked Caroline. This was always
a good beginning because it could lead to all sorts of confessions.</p>

<p>He shook his head. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm from California. I‚Äôm from Los
Angeles.‚Äù</p>

<p>She was impressed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where Hollywood is, isn‚Äôt it?
You from Hollywood?‚Äù</p>

<p>No, he was not from Hollywood. He lived near by.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôd certainly like to visit out there.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not as interesting as New York.‚Äù</p>

<p>She gave a little laugh to show her scorn for New York,
her laugh leveling the buildings and cracking Grant‚Äôs Tomb.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs awful here,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe have an awful climate.‚Äù</p>

<p>He raised the buildings again. ‚ÄúOh, I think it‚Äôs pretty exciting.
You‚Äôve got so many things. This is really the first
time I‚Äôve seen New York. Bob and I went overseas from here
and we came back here but I never really saw the town.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAre you regular army?‚Äù she asked. Men in uniform were
becoming rare.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm getting out soon. I signed up for a little while
longer.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh.‚Äù</p>

<p>He and Robert Holton began to talk then about the
army and she felt shut out. She stood there wondering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
whether she should go or not. She rather liked this young
man. He was a lieutenant, at least he had one bar on his
shoulder and she thought that lieutenants wore a single bar:
the war had been such a long time ago and she had forgotten
so many things.</p>

<p>He had dark eyes and bleached-looking hair which Caroline
had always found attractive in men. His skin was rather
pale for a Californian; all Californians had brown skin in her
imagination. He was not particularly handsome, though he
looked rather distinguished, with sharp features and circles
under his eyes.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAre you in the East long?‚Äù she asked.</p>

<p>He looked at her as if he had forgotten she was there;
still, he was very polite. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm only here for a week.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúLooking around?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, looking around.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúCaroline,‚Äù said Robert Holton, as though explaining an
important thing, ‚ÄúCaroline is the belle of the office.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI can see that,‚Äù said Trebling without too much effort,
saying it almost naturally, a hard thing to do.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, thank you,‚Äù said Caroline. Now she didn‚Äôt know what
to say. She looked at his ribbons. She counted them mechanically,
the way she did before the war ended: five ribbons.
‚ÄúYou must‚Äôve been around quite a bit,‚Äù she said finally,
speaking before the silence her last words had made became
another conversation.</p>

<p>Trebling nodded seriously. ‚ÄúYes, I saw quite a bit. No
more than Bob did, though.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat must‚Äôve been nice,‚Äù said Caroline, ‚Äúyour being able
to serve together everywhere.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, it was.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>She knew that they were waiting for her to go but she
wasn‚Äôt ready yet. ‚ÄúDo you like being in the army in peacetime?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, not particularly.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôll be out soon, I suppose.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúQuite soon.‚Äù</p>

<p>She had to go now. She couldn‚Äôt understand what kept her
standing there foolishly trying to make a conversation by
herself. It was not as if Lieutenant Trebling were handsome
or unusual.</p>

<p>Caroline made her great effort. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI guess
I‚Äôll see you later, Mr Trebling.‚Äù Was that the right name?
She wasn‚Äôt sure. She hoped she hadn‚Äôt said it wrong.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNice to have met you, Caroline.‚Äù She smiled at him, her
face at a three-quarter angle: her most flattering angle.
Then, with great nonchalance, she walked slowly back to
her desk.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Trebling was surprised at the way Holton looked out of
uniform.</p>

<p>To have lived several years with a person who looked always
one way and then to see him later another way is startling.
Jim Trebling had always thought of Holton as a soldier:
he could not get used to him as a civilian in an office.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSit down, Jim.‚Äù Holton pointed to a chair beside his desk.
They both sat down. Trebling felt a little awkward. The
office was too formal for him and he was not at ease.</p>

<p>Jim looked at Holton, trying to get accustomed to him.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve certainly changed. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd have recognized
you.‚Äù</p>

<p>Robert Holton laughed a little self-consciously. ‚ÄúThese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
civilian clothes <em>are</em> different. They make you feel different.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really settling down, I guess.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid so.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI wish I could. Maybe I will when I get out ... I don‚Äôt
know.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat do you think you‚Äôre going to do?‚Äù</p>

<p>Jim shrugged. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve been thinking of starting
some kind of a business. You know, what we used to talk
about before you got out.‚Äù</p>

<p>Holton nodded. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good idea, I guess. I thought of
it, too, but of course the odds are against you.‚Äù</p>

<p>Trebling was surprised to hear Holton say this. ‚ÄúI know
it,‚Äù he said.</p>

<p>Holton saw then that he hadn‚Äôt said the right thing. He
tried to explain. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt start a business.
I just mean something might go wrong.‚Äù He was saying
worse things now; he stopped.</p>

<p>Jim changed the subject. ‚ÄúHow do you like being out?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs pretty wonderful. Just to be able to stay in one
place....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs nice for a while.‚Äù</p>

<p>Holton sighed. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever travel again.‚Äù</p>

<p>Jim was surprised. ‚ÄúI thought you were going to go around
the world. Don‚Äôt you remember when we used to talk about
seeing more of Italy?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, maybe sometime. I hadn‚Äôt stopped moving for very
long then.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs right, you hadn‚Äôt.‚Äù As they talked Jim Trebling
became more uneasy. This was a person he had not met
before and he was surprised and sorry. Robert Holton had
been different as a soldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>As they talked, the words forming conventional patterns
and hiding their real thoughts, Jim thought of the war.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou remember the time we were in Florence?‚Äù</p>

<p>Holton said that he remembered it very well.</p>

<p>They spoke then of Florence and as they talked Jim Trebling
began to remember many things.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The city had been liberated for several months. The war
was almost over and Holton and Trebling were able to take a
week‚Äôs leave: they went to Florence.</p>

<p>Parts of the city had been badly damaged. The old buildings
on the Arno had been leveled in many places but the
Ponte Vecchio was still there. These things had not been
very important, however, because they had not gone to see
antiques. They had gone to rest, to meet women, and to try
to find enough liquor to get drunk on.</p>

<p>They stayed with a family outside of the town; they
stayed in a place called Fiesole.</p>

<p>Trebling remembered the house clearly: long and rambling,
dirty-white stucco with small iron balconies beneath
the larger windows. A rock garden, dusty gray-green olive
trees and an unearthly view of the valley in which was
Florence.</p>

<p>The house belonged to a family named Bruno, friends of
Robert Holton‚Äôs mother. They had invited the two of them
to stay as long as they liked: in those days it was a good
policy to have American soldiers in one‚Äôs home.</p>

<p>Robert Holton had liked a girl named Carla. Trebling had
liked her too, but not as much as Holton did. He remembered
one night when the three had sat on the terrace,
watching the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>It was summer and the night was warm and vibrant. The
city lights glittered in the valley-cup; the lights were golden
and flickering and the river shone darkly.</p>

<p>They sat on a stone ledge, their feet dangling above the
rock garden. Carla was between them; her hair was dark and
her face pale. They sat like this, watching the lights of the
city and listening to the sound of insects whirring in the
night.</p>

<p>And Jim had said, embarrassed by the long silence, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs
so peaceful here.‚Äù</p>

<p>The other two acted as if they had not heard him. Holton,
sitting close beside Carla, touched her.</p>

<p>And then she had said, ‚ÄúIt seems like such a long time
ago.‚Äù They thought of this as they sat in the blue darkness.</p>

<p>Holton finally spoke, saying, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it a shame that this
has to change again?‚Äù</p>

<p>They had been surprised to hear him say this; Trebling
was more surprised than Carla because, though he had
known Holton longer, she knew him better. Trebling was
surprised to hear Holton speak seriously: he was never serious
at other times. He always tried to be funny.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy <em>should</em> this change again?‚Äù asked Carla, looking at
him, trying to tell his expression in the dark.</p>

<p>Holton only sighed and said, ‚ÄúBecause everything changes
when you go away.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou can come back,‚Äù said Carla and Jim remembered
now the exact way she had said that and he was sorry for
her.</p>

<p>Holton didn‚Äôt answer for a moment and then he had said,
‚ÄúYes, I suppose you can.‚Äù They knew then that he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
not come back and Trebling could sense her sadness as they
watched the lights flickering below them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‚ÄúDo you remember Carla?‚Äù asked Jim suddenly, his mind
adjusting to the present.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe girl in Florence? Sure, I remember her. Was that her
name ... Carla?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúShe was very nice looking, wasn‚Äôt she?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSure, I remember her.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI thought you liked her quite a bit,‚Äù said Trebling, not
looking at Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI suppose I did. We ran into a lot of people, though.
There were so many people.‚Äù</p>

<p>Trebling agreed that there had been a number of people
in Europe, people they had known.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat was a good town, Florence,‚Äù said Holton suddenly.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt was.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe were there a week, weren‚Äôt we?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAbout that.‚Äù</p>

<p>Holton nodded, and Trebling watched him to see how he
felt; Holton‚Äôs face told him nothing, though. He was only
remembering.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs certainly a nice feeling to be out,‚Äù said Holton
finally.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI guess it must be.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNot having to worry about being moved from place to
place.‚Äù</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They were standing in the Roman Forum. All around them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
were pieces of shattered marble, shattered in earlier wars.
Trebling and Holton had looked at three slender columns of
marble, all that was left of a temple.</p>

<p>Trebling had remarked, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bet those pillars are pretty
old.‚Äù</p>

<p>Holton agreed, ‚ÄúMaybe a thousand years old.‚Äù</p>

<p>Together they had looked at the three columns of the
ruined temple.</p>

<p>Trebling asked, ‚ÄúDo you think you would‚Äôve ever gotten
here except in the army?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo. I don‚Äôt guess so.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI probably wouldn‚Äôt have either.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sort of interesting.‚Äù</p>

<p>And Trebling had said, ‚ÄúI like the traveling part of all
this.‚Äù</p>

<p>Robert Holton agreed to this and then they began to complain
about other things.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Trebling sat back in his chair and looked around the office.
He didn‚Äôt like offices and he didn‚Äôt like this one at all. The
clear constant light standardized the people in the room.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow do you like it here?‚Äù he asked.</p>

<p>Holton shrugged. ‚ÄúO.K., I suppose. It‚Äôs something to do.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôll stay in this sort of work?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúProbably, I don‚Äôt know yet.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI had thought you might go into this new thing with
me.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell....‚Äù</p>

<p>Neither spoke for a moment.</p>

<p>Finally Trebling asked, ‚ÄúCan I smoke in here?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Jim, but....‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúSure, I know: rules.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. These people are awful stiff about a lot of
things.‚Äù</p>

<p>Jim Trebling wished again that he hadn‚Äôt come. He had
an impulse to run away. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you doing tonight?‚Äù he
asked finally.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to a big cocktail party.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBeing social, eh?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, you know you have to make contacts...‚Äù he continued,
explaining himself carefully.</p>

<p>Then Holton asked Jim about himself, and he listened as
Jim talked. The cataloguing of army camps, the different
duties in each, the girl he had decided to marry and then
didn‚Äôt, his current leave of absence, the trip across the country,
the pleasure of seeing Robert Holton again.</p>

<p>Trebling told this story automatically, as one always tells
a much-told personal story and as he told this he wondered
what had happened to Holton.</p>

<p>In the war he had been considered wild. He had spent
most of the time laughing at things. He had been easily
bored and now he was changed.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt must be nice to be out,‚Äù Trebling repeated, not knowing
what else to say.</p>

<p>And Robert Holton explained to him in detail why it was
so nice to be free.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Paris had been the most interesting place of all. They had
spent two days there. Trebling had been very conscientious
and had insisted that they see palaces and landmarks and
they had actually tried to see a few but then Holton decided
that there was not enough time for that. They met two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
girls. Trebling could not remember their names; he could
remember nothing about them except that they were rather
pretty and claimed to be sisters.</p>

<p>The girls had suggested they go on a picnic. Holton had
liked this idea and he managed to get some food from the
mess officer of a near-by company. They took bicycles and
drove out of Paris. They rode through S√®vres and some small
towns on the outskirts. They approached Versailles but the
girls didn‚Äôt care to go into the town and so they turned left
from the main road. At a small town called Jouy-en-Josas
they stopped, and on the dark green lawn of a bombed-out
ch√¢teau they had their picnic.</p>

<p>The sky was overcast that day. And the woods that surrounded
the ch√¢teau were blue and smoky and looked mysterious,
like the pictures of enchanted forests in children‚Äôs
books.</p>

<p>When they had finished lunch Holton wanted to go walk
in the woods. Only one of the girls spoke English.</p>

<p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take a walk in the woods,‚Äù Holton suggested.</p>

<p>The two girls giggled and talked together very quickly in
French. The one who spoke English finally said, ‚ÄúSure, we
go walk in the woods with you.‚Äù They walked in the woods.</p>

<p>Hand in hand the two couples walked between the misty
trees. There was no underbrush here and the trees came up
out of the stony, grass-covered ground, free and straight.</p>

<p>The two girls understood what was expected of them. His
most vivid memory was not of the one he had but of Holton‚Äôs:
a stocky, pink-faced girl. He remembered clearly the
way her head lolled against the tree, her eyes closed and her
thick lips slightly ajar. He remembered that her hair was
almost the same color as the bark of the tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúSay, Bob, do you remember those two girls from Paris?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhen was that?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou know, the time we went on the picnic.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôve forgotten.‚Äù That was that.</p>

<p>A large important-looking man came into the office. When
he saw Trebling with Holton he stopped in the middle of
the room, changed his course with the unself-conscious dignity
of a schooner under full sail, and walked straight over
to them.</p>

<p>Holton got to his feet quickly and Trebling did the same,
sensing that this was a person of importance.</p>

<p>‚ÄúJim Trebling, this is Mr Murphy, the Chief of our section.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúGlad to meet you, Lieutenant.‚Äù They shook hands vigorously,
Mr Murphy smiling with goodwill.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, Lieutenant, I suppose you‚Äôll be getting out soon?‚Äù</p>

<p>Mechanically Trebling explained what he was planning
to do.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThink you‚Äôll go into Business?‚Äù asked Mr Murphy.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMaybe, I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúLot of openings now for a young man who wants to get
ahead.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThere probably are.‚Äù</p>

<p>They talked for a while of Business as though it were a
state of being.</p>

<p>Trebling looked at Holton as Mr Murphy talked, looked at
him, trying to find something familiar in his face. For a moment
as he looked he thought he could see a tightness about
the mouth, an effort at control but Jim Trebling could not
tell what Holton was controlling and the mouth soon relaxed
and he could tell nothing then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>Coming back on the boat together they had talked of
what they were going to do when they got out.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think I‚Äôd like to make money,‚Äù said Holton, looking at
the white wake of the ship.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a bad idea. How?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúDamned if I know.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe could always start that pottery business I was telling
you about, back in California.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a thought.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOf course there‚Äôre a lot of other things we could do.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI suppose it‚Äôs all a matter of picking the right one.‚Äù</p>

<p>They looked at the gray water and thought of new things,
of works not yet begun. Pensively Holton leaned out over
the railing and spat. Trebling, interested, did the same. For
several moments they were in serious contest to determine
who could spit the farthest. Holton won, although Trebling
claimed he had been helped by a gust of wind.</p>

<p>Then they walked about the decks of the transport. Soldiers
were everywhere. They sat in groups on the covered
hatches, they leaned over the railing to look at the sea and,
also, to be sick.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI guess all these people are going to be trying the same
thing,‚Äù said Holton suddenly.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTry what? Starting a business?‚Äù</p>

<p>Sure.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúA lot of them will.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI guess it could work.‚Äù They stopped amidships and
looked out to sea again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd certainly like to have a lot of
money,‚Äù said Holton sincerely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúSo would I,‚Äù said Trebling with casual sincerity.</p>

<p>They had decided then to start in together when they got
out of the army. Holton had been discharged first, however,
and he had immediately joined Heywood and Golden. In his
occasional letters Holton never mentioned the business again.
Trebling remembered that now and was sorry so much had
changed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr Murphy was talking about Business.</p>

<p>Holton was listening to him with what appeared to be
interest. Trebling shook himself and tried to act as if he had
been following the lesson Mr Murphy had been giving him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúVery nice to have met you, Lieutenant,‚Äù said Mr Murphy
at last.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNice to meet you.‚Äù They shook hands. Mr Murphy turned
to Holton. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to see you for a moment if your friend
doesn‚Äôt mind.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúCertainly.‚Äù Holton gestured to Trebling to stay where
he was. Then Mr Murphy and Holton went over to the other
end of the office where the windows were.</p>

<p>Jim Trebling sat in his uncomfortable chair beneath the
fluorescent lights. He wanted to leave this office, leave it
now and not come back. He couldn‚Äôt understand Holton any
longer. He no longer knew him.</p>

<p>Trebling was aware of someone standing beside him. He
looked up: it was the blue-eyed girl. He started to get to
his feet.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just passing by. Mr Murphy
and Bob seem to be having some sort of conference. I
thought I‚Äôd wait outside the gate till they were through.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSit down,‚Äù said Trebling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù She sat down in the chair beside him. He
wondered what to say to her, what to talk about.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHave you been here long?‚Äù he asked.</p>

<p>She told him that she had been there for several years.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt must be interesting working in a place like this.‚Äù</p>

<p>She laughed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty awful, I think. As jobs go, of
course, it‚Äôs not bad.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut you‚Äôd rather not work at all.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôll probably be married soon.‚Äù This was a leading
question. There was a simple ritual to conversation with
pretty girls who might be had.</p>

<p>She recognized this and answered according to the ritual,
‚ÄúOh, maybe someday, when I meet the right person.‚Äù</p>

<p>This could mean a lot. He was interested now. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs important,
meeting the right person.‚Äù</p>

<p>They were both silent, thinking how important it was to
meet the right person.</p>

<p>Trebling began to think of this girl (was her name Caroline?)
quite seriously. It was such an important thing to discover:
if she could be had or not. For one night she might
be very pleasant. He liked the way she looked. But then he
thought of certain other one-night stands and of the phone
calls and letters and emotion that often came of them. He
would be very careful about this. He resumed.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI suppose you can have a pretty good time in New York
if you know the right places to go.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, there are some nice places. You have to be very
careful, though.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúA lot of them are clip joints, I guess.‚Äù</p>

<p>She laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll say they are.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúDepends, I guess, on who you go out with.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, you should know your way around.‚Äù</p>

<p>They were drawing nearer and nearer to the act. Everything
was going well. She was returning all his signals. He
began to breathe a little hard as they approached the gateway.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI know so few people in New York,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBob‚Äôs really
the only person I know well. I don‚Äôt know any girls.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, there‚Äôre a lot of them around.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI know.‚Äù He paused and then he began to speak carefully
but casually. ‚ÄúI was going out tonight but I don‚Äôt think
I will now.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not much fun alone.‚Äù This was said almost pathetically.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat about Bob?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to that cocktail party.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, yes, I forgot.‚Äù A pause now, a silence with great
meaning in it.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù and he was saying it at last, ‚Äúmaybe <em>you</em> might
go out with me tonight.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúMe!‚Äù Surprise, pleasure, a certain asperity, all these emotions
splendidly portrayed in that one word. ‚ÄúWell....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOf course if you‚Äôre busy....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, no....‚Äù She spoke almost too quickly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really
certain,‚Äù she added, regaining her dignity. ‚ÄúPerhaps you
might call me back around five. I‚Äôll know then.‚Äù At that moment
both of them knew.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat would be fine. I hope you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ...‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúCertainly not.‚Äù Then she said that any friend of Bob‚Äôs was
a friend of hers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>Trebling felt pleased with himself for having managed so
well. It might take a week but it would still be pleasant. He
looked forward to the final moment of yielding. He sighed
and started to think of other things.</p>

<p>Caroline, seeing that Holton was on his way back, got up
from her chair. ‚ÄúNice to have seen you, Lieutenant. I‚Äôll be
looking forward to your call.‚Äù</p>

<p>He also stood up. ‚ÄúI hope you can make it.‚Äù She said that
she did, too, and they both knew what was going to happen.
Robert Holton came back and Caroline left.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a pretty girl,‚Äù said Trebling.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCaroline? Yes, she‚Äôs pretty nice.‚Äù</p>

<p>They stood looking at each other awkwardly. ‚ÄúShall we
get together tomorrow evening?‚Äù suggested Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSure, that‚Äôd be fine.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, listen, Jim, it‚Äôs been wonderful seeing you....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôve enjoyed it....‚Äù Their voices intermingled into
a single sound. Neither of them listened to the words of the
other.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSee you tomorrow then, Bob?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSee you then.‚Äù They said good-bye and Jim Trebling left
the office. As he stood in the reception room waiting for the
elevator he felt sad at the way Holton had changed. It was
such a shame because they had once been very close. Then
Jim Trebling thought of Caroline and he felt happier. The
Carolines were the important things.</p>

<p>The elevator door opened and he stepped inside.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><em>Chapter Eight</em></h2>
</div>


<p class="p2">At five-thirty the world ceased to be official and became
private.</p>

<p>Happily Robert Holton put away his books and figures
and prepared to leave. Monday was over and he wouldn‚Äôt
let himself think of the other days of his week.</p>

<p>Caroline was putting on her hat and Mr Murphy sat at
his desk behind her, dreaming, his eyes fixed shrewdly upon
nothing.</p>

<p>Robert Holton walked over to Caroline.</p>

<p>‚ÄúReady to go?‚Äù</p>

<p>She nodded. ‚ÄúAll ready.‚Äù Together they walked through
the emptying offices, rode down the crowded elevator, and
stepped out into the more crowded street.</p>

<p>The sky was gray now and the sun had vanished behind
buildings. The air was cool and the smell of exhaust was
strong as cars moved slowly in the streets, trying to escape
to less crowded places. They walked with the stream of
people toward the subway opening. They talked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGuess what?‚Äù said Caroline.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm going out tonight.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm going out with Lieutenant Trebling.‚Äù</p>

<p>He was surprised. ‚ÄúThat was fast work. Did he do that
while he was in the office?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe talked about it. He called me back later and I told
him I‚Äôd go out with him.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, well.‚Äù Holton was admiring but Caroline was not
sure whether he was admiring her or Trebling.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs nice,‚Äù she said, not committing herself.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, he‚Äôs a good guy.‚Äù</p>

<p>They crossed a street nervously and in silence. On the
other side they went on talking.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTell me something about him?‚Äù she asked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not much to tell. He‚Äôs from the West Coast. He
went to UCLA, I think, and his old man‚Äôs in the insurance
business. He went into the army about the same time I did
and he‚Äôs still in.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I want to know.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, what do you want to know?‚Äù</p>

<p>She had trouble saying this. ‚ÄúOh, you know ... the sort
of person he is. All that sort of thing.‚Äù</p>

<p>Robert Holton, who hadn‚Äôt thought much about it, had a
hard time answering. ‚ÄúI guess he‚Äôs what you‚Äôd call a dreamer.
He‚Äôs not very practical. He always wants to start things ...
businesses, you know. In the war he was pretty good and
other people liked him. He wasn‚Äôt very wild then.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIs he now?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúJust his ideas. In those days I used to be the wild one.‚Äù</p>

<p>She laughed and thought he was joking with her and this
made him angry and sad but there was nothing he could do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
about it because he had assumed a certain identity with her
and it had to be maintained.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll bet you were wild!‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe all change,‚Äù he said.</p>

<p>She wasn‚Äôt interested in how he‚Äôd changed, though: she
was interested in Jim Trebling. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt suppose he‚Äôs engaged
or anything like that?‚Äù She was casual.</p>

<p>Holton laughed. ‚ÄúNo, you can get him if you want to.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean that at all. What do you mean by saying
that?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNot a thing.‚Äù</p>

<p>She went on talking for several moments, trying to be indignant.
Then they crossed another street and she stopped
talking.</p>

<p>They walked with the current of people, walked uncomfortably
but deliberately over the sidewalk ventilators of the
subway beneath. As they walked they could feel the thunder
of a subway train under their feet, vibrating upward,
like a great emotion, into their stomachs.</p>

<p>Then they came to the opening of the subway. With a
deep breath they descended into the pit. Like lemmings
dashing seaward the people pushed down the steps and into
already crowded trains.</p>

<p>Caroline and Holton were separated. A sudden push of
the crowd threw her into the train just before the door
closed. He caught a last glimpse of her serene beauty being
crushed between a large Negress and a tall white man. The
train gave a rumble and pulled away.</p>

<p>Holton stood on the concrete platform with a hundred
others who had missed this train and were waiting for the
next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>He walked up and down between the concrete pillars,
looking at the broken machines which were supposed to sell
gum and peanuts and, from habit, he put his finger into one
of the slots to see if anything was there: nothing was there
however.</p>

<p>He admired the advertisements. His favorite one, the girl
advertising beer, was not in this station but there were
others. Two very excellent ones of movie actresses, young
women hauntingly attractive with red lips. He admired these
even though the most beautiful actress of all had had her
front teeth blacked out and a crude phallic image drawn
over her passionate face. There were people in the world
who would do those things, of course, and he was not annoyed.</p>

<p>The other advertisements were less interesting and he
didn‚Äôt look at them very long.</p>

<p>Another train roared through the tunnel, stopping with
great noise; the doors opened and people flowed out; then
another rush to get on the train. Robert Holton allowed himself
to be carried into the hot stale car.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He liked to walk in the Park. In the evenings the Park
was the most peaceful place in the city. A few people would
be sitting on the benches and a few couples would be walking
between trees but there were never many people here in
the early evening and the ones that were there were always
quiet.</p>

<p>As Robert Holton walked the miracle of the street lamps
took place, white light filling the bulbs and changing
the early evening, the twilight period, to a premature night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>He walked quickly now because it was almost six o‚Äôclock.
Mrs Raymond Stevanson‚Äôs cocktail parties often went on
until nine or ten o‚Äôclock and occasionally they lasted all
night but he couldn‚Äôt know this for certain and he didn‚Äôt
want to be late.</p>

<p>Robert Holton thought sadly about Jim Trebling as he
walked, breathing the cool air. A short time had made a lot
of difference and he was aware of this difference.</p>

<p>Trebling was apt to be impractical. It was a likeable quality
in the army; he himself hadn‚Äôt made much sense in those
days, but things had changed now. This was the time to be
practical and Jim Trebling was not.</p>

<p>A couple were embracing beside a large rock. He watched
them with interest as he went by.</p>

<p>He had tried to pretend to be the same but the effort, or
the change, had been too great. It made him unhappy to
think that he and Trebling had really been so different, had
always been so different, even in those days. He was shocked
to think that Trebling remembered the army as a pleasant
period of his life. There had been times, of course....</p>

<p>Another couple came out of the woods, walked to the
pathway and looked uncertainly about them, as though unsure
of themselves. When he glanced at them they looked
at him angrily, as if he had been spying. He walked away.</p>

<p>Robert Holton was not sure why he had changed toward
Trebling. He wanted to be the same. He wanted to take up
the friendship where it had been broken but he could not.
He was not going to change again.</p>

<p>A nurse with a baby carriage was hurrying streetward. It
was late, probably much too late for her to be out with the
baby. As she passed him he caught a glimpse of the child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
and saw that it was staring vacantly ahead, concentrating
upon growth.</p>

<p>He followed the nurse and the carriage toward the street.
Robert Holton smiled to himself when he thought of Caroline
and Jim Trebling going out together. It was always interesting
when people out of different periods of his life
came to know each other. He had never associated Trebling
with Caroline before.</p>

<p>He took a last deep breath of air before he left the Park.
He wished vaguely that he might have more time to walk in
the Park and straighten out certain things.</p>

<p>The uptown streets were not crowded. A few people were
coming home from work; most of the people were already
home by now. Children played together in the streets, shouting
at one another in sharp hoarse voices. A smell of cooking
was in the streets.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was no mail for him.</p>

<p>This was not a good day. On the good days there was
mail; days could be bad when there wasn‚Äôt any. Not that
there was anyone Robert Holton wanted to hear from in particular
but he was less alone when he had letters to read.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBeen a nice day,‚Äù said the person behind the desk.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt certainly has,‚Äù said Robert Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWon‚Äôt be long until it‚Äôs winter,‚Äù said the person behind
the desk.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be long,‚Äù said Holton. He turned then and
walked through the dingy lobby to the elevator.</p>

<p>He and the elevator boy discussed the kind of day it had
been. They also decided that it would be winter soon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>His room looked no more cheerful than usual. Robert
Holton sat down on the bed, leaving the room dark. It gave
him a feeling of power to think that, when he chose, he
could turn on a light and dispel the darkness.</p>

<p>He started to think of Trebling but stopped himself. There
was nothing to be done now. The old friendship was gone.</p>

<p>Trebling had mentioned a girl named Carla. He remembered
her well. She had been pretty and intense and wealthy.
He had not thought about her for a long time. She had been
a strange girl, gentle and understanding. He had been greatly
attracted to her and she to him.</p>

<p>They had walked around Florence and Fiesole. She had
taken him to old palaces and churches although he hadn‚Äôt
wanted to go. When he had objected she told him that she
was trying to show him something. He never knew what it
was she wanted to show him. When he left Florence he told
her that he would write: he didn‚Äôt, though, and he had not
thought of her again until today.</p>

<p>The thing he had liked most about Carla, the thing he
could remember now, was her way of understanding him.
She once told him that it wasn‚Äôt necessary to finish sentences
when they talked; that she knew what he would say and that
he should know what she would say.</p>

<p>Sitting in the dark of his hotel room, Robert Holton
thought of all the women he had known and liked; some he
had slept with and some he hadn‚Äôt. Most of them he had
forgotten. Now he only thought of them when someone else
recalled them to him.</p>

<p>And he did remember about Paris. He remembered the
picnic outside Versailles, although he could not remember
the faces of the two girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>In Europe there had been so many women. He often was
surprised now when he thought of how many he had known.
There were periods when he had been never satisfied. Both
Trebling and he had gone about it like hunters. Trebling
was probably still hunting, thought Holton suddenly, and
he wondered if he was, too. No, that was behind him. He
had to live and act in a different way now. He had to be a
different person.</p>

<p>Robert Holton turned on the light beside his bed. He
blinked in the yellow light and suddenly he was dissatisfied
with the room. He wished for the first time that he were
somewhere else; it didn‚Äôt matter where, just somewhere else.
He was a person of great logic, though, and he asked himself
what he would rather be doing and he couldn‚Äôt think of anything
else to do. He didn‚Äôt want to travel. He had no desire
to escape. There was no place to escape to anyway and Robert
Holton who had a kind of wisdom knew that.</p>

<p>Then he took his clothes off and got under the shower.
This was usually the happiest part of his day. The warm
water gave him a feeling of security, relaxing him; the world
fell into a genial perspective. He finished bathing reluctantly
and dressed quickly.</p>

<p>Finally he stood in front of the mirror again and combed
his hair. He was glad to see that he wasn‚Äôt losing his hair.
Sometimes he thought he was; at other times he knew he
wasn‚Äôt.</p>

<p>He wasn‚Äôt displeased with himself. He wasn‚Äôt pleased
either but he knew that he was acceptable. There was no use
in worrying, anyway. He wished sometimes that his nose
could have been more aquiline. He would like to look more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
impressive. Perhaps his face would get that way as he grew
older. He turned away from the mirror.</p>

<p>He looked at the picture on the wall and wondered for the
hundredth time why the painter had made everything look
so blue. The painter had made one of the apples almost sky-blue
and Robert Holton had never seen an apple that color
before and he found it hard to believe that there was much
advantage in so misrepresenting things. Perhaps in certain
parts of France the apples were blue.</p>

<p>He was dressed and ready now. He looked at his watch
and saw that it was a quarter to seven: he would have to
hurry. Robert Holton looked around the room to see if there
was anything he wanted to take with him. There wasn‚Äôt. He
put on his trench coat, turned out the light, and left the
room.</p>

<p>The elevator boy wanted to know if he was going to a
party.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôm going to a big party.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúLots of girls, I bet.‚Äù The pale thin elevator boy was interested.</p>

<p>‚ÄúA whole lot of them.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBoy, I wish I was going out to something like that. This
night work is getting me down. I ain‚Äôt getting much relaxation.‚Äù
He winked to show what he meant by relaxation and
Holton smiled sympathetically.</p>

<p>Robert Holton stopped by the desk.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back pretty early,‚Äù he said to the clerk. He always
told them when to expect him, told them from force of habit
because no one ever wanted to know.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù said the clerk. ‚ÄúNice night tonight,‚Äù he added.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNice fall night,‚Äù agreed Robert Holton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>They discussed the evening politely. Then Robert Holton
left the hotel.</p>

<p>It was darker now and cooler. The night was refreshing
and he felt suddenly strong and contented. The depression
of the office left him and he was becoming alive. He prepared
himself for the party and for the evening ahead. He
walked briskly down the street and, to emphasize his mood
of sudden power, he hailed a taxi and rode in it happily,
without regret for the money he was spending.</p>

<p class="p2">The party seemed to be going well. Although Mrs. Raymond
Stevanson hated cocktail parties, finding her own almost
as bad as other people‚Äôs, she still felt she had to give
them and she worked very hard to make them outstanding.</p>

<p>Several hundred well-dressed people wandered about her
large apartment, looking at the furniture, each other, and
the five different paintings of Mrs Stevanson. There were no
traces of Mr Stevanson in the apartment. He had died early
in her career, leaving her his money and four race horses.
She had sold the horses and she had saved quite a bit of the
money. Now, at fifty-five, she was a famous hostess and
somewhat overweight.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood evening, Helena.‚Äù Mrs Stevanson turned around
and saw the thin malicious face of Beatrice Jordan. They
were contemporaries.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBeatrice! How marvelous!‚Äù They touched cheeks with
slight frowns, then came apart again with affectionate smiles.</p>

<p>Beatrice stood back a moment and looked at Mrs Stevanson.
Beatrice was extremely nearsighted but much too vain
to wear glasses. To see clearly she was forced to tuck her
chin down and look upward, a habit which had given her
an undeserved reputation as a coquette. She did this now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúHelena, you‚Äôve lost weight! How?‚Äù</p>

<p>Mrs Stevanson was pleased. ‚ÄúDoes it really show?‚Äù She
patted her cement-hard corseted buttock.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNot so much around there,‚Äù said Beatrice, thinking for a
moment. ‚ÄúMore around here.‚Äù She touched her own meager
breasts.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou think so?‚Äù Mrs Stevanson was irritated and angry
with herself for allowing Beatrice Jordan to say such a thing.
Mrs Stevanson was proud of her breasts. Several of the
famous painters had called her voluptuous.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been lovely seeing you, Helena darling. I‚Äôve got to
join my escort now. I came with Clyde.‚Äù</p>

<p>Beatrice said this triumphantly but gained no victory.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou came with Clyde. How wonderful! I‚Äôm dining with
him tomorrow.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIndeed?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIs he here now?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in the other room.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúDo tell him to see me before he leaves. There are <em>so</em>
many people here.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI will, darling. Lovely to see you.‚Äù Beatrice smiled, showing
her artful white false teeth and Mrs Stevanson smiled
back showing her own artful white false teeth. The two
women parted.</p>

<p>Mrs Stevanson was annoyed but she had found that the
older she got the less interested she was in what people
said. It was well known anyway that Beatrice Jordan was a
cat.</p>

<p>Mrs Stevanson walked now from group to group. The
groups unfolded for her like flowers before the sun. She
would disappear for a moment into the heart of one and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
then it would unfold again, release her and become tight and
compact once more.</p>

<p>Certain groups contained people more important than
other groups. In these she lingered longest, smiling the
most attractively, saying her superlatives.</p>

<p>In the dining room a buffet had been set on a long table.
Three footmen (hired for the evening only) guarded it from
the hungry-looking guests, betrayed it to the superior ones
who were not hungry.</p>

<p>Twenty or thirty people were gathered here and they
looked rather self-conscious as she approached. Somehow
everyone felt rather guilty to be caught eating heavily (they
<em>were</em> eating heavily, she noticed) at a cocktail party.</p>

<p>She moved heartily about the dining room, demanding
that they eat more, suggesting they try something they had
not already tried. And then, to show she was mortal, she ate
a piece of white bread with Virginia ham on it.</p>

<p>The dining room under control, Mrs Stevanson marched
back through the drawing room, accepted greetings and
homage with a tiny smile that one of her lovers (he was dead
now) had said reminded him of La Gioconda.</p>

<p>Mrs Stevanson, among other things, believed in art. Tonight
she had invited several writers, a few painters, one
sculptor whose name she couldn‚Äôt remember, and a half-dozen
actors whose names everyone knew.</p>

<p>She had also invited George <em>Robert</em> Lewis. For some obscure
reason his middle name was always Gallicized, legitimatizing
the Lewis. He had been born and raised in Alabama.
Unfortunately for his family he had very early shown
a passion for the artistic as well as a marked tendency
toward Socratic love. When he decided that the thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
he most wanted was to go to Paris and become an artist, his
family did not object; in fact, his father had suggested that
if he wanted to live the rest of his life in Paris it was all
right with him. Lewis lived there in the Nineteen-Thirties.
He returned in the Forties.</p>

<p>Mrs Stevanson thought him cute and she was in the habit
of telling her friends that, although his habits were shocking,
he was still quite charming and so <em>advanced</em>. And then
he was marvelously decadent and the decadent was becoming
popular now that the artificial virility of war was safely
past.</p>

<p>George <em>Robert</em> Lewis was also an interesting person to
know because he was the editor of <cite>Regarde</cite>, a magazine
which had been called <em>avant garde</em> before that phrase became
old-fashioned. Under his editorship the magazine had
advanced all new things in the hope that one of the new
things thus championed would be a success. So far none had
but he still was championing and, though Mrs Stevanson
seldom understood a word he said, she felt he was awfully
brave to say the dreadful things he did about people and
morals, especially people.</p>

<p>Lewis was talking to a small brown man whom she didn‚Äôt
remember inviting.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDear Helena,‚Äù said Lewis as she approached, ‚Äúyou look
wonderfully well-preserved.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúGeorge, you‚Äôre a devil,‚Äù said Mrs Stevanson, secretly
pleased.</p>

<p>Lewis embraced her in much the same way Beatrice Jordan
had. ‚ÄúWhat mad things have you been doing, Helena?
Something naughty, I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù His innocent blue eyes sparkled
as he spoke. He had the expressions of a child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúNothing that you couldn‚Äôt equal. It was delightful of you
to come.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI was so bored, darling, I felt that if I stayed home another
moment I should go completely out of my mind.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúPoor thing.‚Äù They talked this way with each other, talked
with the casual rudeness of people who have met each other
at many parties. He was an amazing person, thought Mrs
Stevanson, looking at him carefully. He was slim and not
very tall, with a pretty feminine face and, except for the
small bitter lines about his mouth, he looked as if he were
still in his twenties. His actual age was unknown. Mrs
Stevanson thought he was forty.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd whom have we here?‚Äù asked Mrs Stevanson, turning
to face the small brown man beside him, a social smile
on her face.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy, don‚Äôt you know ... this is....‚Äù He said the name
quickly. It was something foreign and difficult. She would
have to call Lewis up the next day and ask him. She shook
hands with the little man and saw that he was impressed
with her. She smiled as George <em>Robert</em> Lewis explained him.
He was a Greek and a professor and he knew a lot about
poetry.</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>But</em> Helena, he has the most fabulous philosophy. I really
think it‚Äôs never been done before. What was it again, Timon?‚Äù
Mrs Stevanson knew his first name now.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure Mrs Stevanson wouldn‚Äôt be interested.‚Äù As a
matter of fact Mrs Stevanson wasn‚Äôt interested but she encouraged
him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI should love to know,‚Äù she said. How like an earthenware
pot he looks, she thought as he began to tell her his
theory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúYou see it is based on the legend of the Golden Fleece.
I have substituted the artistic ultimate in place of the fleece
and, to carry the myth to its final parallel, I envisage all
artists as traveling upon an Argosy....‚Äù She listened politely,
carefully to the sound of the words, ignoring their
meanings. She glanced up and down the large white-paneled
room. No one was drunk.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it stimulating?‚Äù asked Lewis when the Greek named
Timon had finished.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWonderful,‚Äù murmured Mrs Stevanson.</p>

<p>The Greek flushed happily. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the Argosy‚Äôs
ever been interpreted quite that way before.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it hasn‚Äôt,‚Äù agreed Mrs Stevanson. She was becoming
impatient now. Her own Argosy would have to begin
again. More guests were arriving.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHave you seen the new ballet?‚Äù asked Lewis suddenly.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, I haven‚Äôt seemed to have had the time.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs dreadful. But the boy...‚Äù Lewis made little motions
with his hand, with his mouth, with his body. His eyes glittered
their blue innocence, their cheerful pleasure. He described
the boy to her and in great detail he told her how
he was going to arrange a meeting.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too clever to stay alive, my pet,‚Äù said Mrs Stevanson.
She hoped that none of her other guests were overhearing
this. Most of them were quite worldly but a few weren‚Äôt
and it would never do to have them hear him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI must ...‚Äù began Mrs Stevanson moving slowly away.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSo nice to have met you,‚Äù said the small Greek named
Timon.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe pleasure ...‚Äù murmured Mrs Stevanson.</p>

<p>Lewis waved to her. ‚ÄúI shall see you later, Helena.‚Äù Mrs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
Stevanson wondered irritably why fairies had to have such
unpleasant voices.</p>

<p>Several new arrivals were in the foyer. She recognized Mr
Heywood immediately. He was passively allowing one of the
footmen to take his overcoat away from him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHeywood dear, it was so nice of you to come.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to be here, Helena.‚Äù He looked unhappily at the
footman, retreating with the overcoat.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd where is your lovely wife?‚Äù Mrs Stevanson knew
perfectly well they were no longer on speaking terms.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMy wife?‚Äù Heywood became dreamy, vague and distant.
‚ÄúOh, she‚Äôs not well at all.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúReally? Do tell me what‚Äôs wrong. I‚Äôve a very good doctor,
you know.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing, really. She has trouble with her head. I
think it‚Äôs her head.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúMigraine,‚Äù said Mrs Stevanson firmly, leading Heywood
now into the drawing room. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been a martyr to it myself.
You know,‚Äù and she lowered her voice, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs due
to change of life.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúReally, Helena!‚Äù Heywood was gently shocked. He made
a restraining motion with his white limp hairless hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm
sure she‚Äôs much too young for that.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, you never can tell,‚Äù said Mrs Stevanson who knew
Mrs Heywood‚Äôs exact age.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat a lot of people,‚Äù sighed Heywood. ‚ÄúSo many
people.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThere <em>are</em> a lot,‚Äù said Mrs Stevanson proudly. ‚ÄúAs usual
I don‚Äôt know half of them.‚Äù</p>

<p>Carefully she cut Mr Heywood away from her, allowed
him to float unprotected through the groups of people. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
looked back at her sadly but she had no pity for him and,
finally, a group of Wall Street people swallowed him up and
she saw him no more.</p>

<p>Several people were entering the drawing room. They
walked slowly with the carefully controlled uneasiness of
people who didn‚Äôt know the hostess well.</p>

<p>She recognized one of the newcomers and she greeted him
joyfully: Ulysses returned to Ithaca, as the small Greek
named Timon might have said.</p>

<p>The man she knew introduced her to the others. Most of
them were English and she had a great admiration for the
English. It was not particularly fashionable to like them
now but she still was fascinated by them because they could
talk without moving their lips. It <em>was</em> rather wonderful.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd this,‚Äù said the man she knew, ‚Äúis Mrs Bankton.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow do you do,‚Äù said Mrs Bankton in a low voice. She
was not English; Mrs Stevanson could tell that right away.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve met before, I think?‚Äù A hint of question was in
Mrs Stevanson‚Äôs voice.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we have.‚Äù</p>

<p>Mrs Bankton was definitely not English. Her accent was
French or Spanish or Italian. Mrs Stevanson could never tell
one from the other.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMrs Bankton‚Äôs husband is the artist,‚Äù said the man she
knew slightly.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù said Mrs Stevanson wondering who Bankton
was. ‚ÄúCertainly, I know. But you‚Äôre not English, my dear?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, madame, I‚Äôm not English.‚Äù Mrs Bankton smiled at
her and made no further admissions. Mrs Stevanson looked
at her with dislike. She liked to find out about people
quickly. Life was too short to have them hold back important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
facts and, ultimately, confidences. People always confided
in Mrs Stevanson, knowing that she was not sufficiently
interested in them to repeat what she heard.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI do hope you‚Äôll enjoy yourself,‚Äù said Mrs Stevanson
more cordially than she would have done had she liked the
person.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù murmured Mrs Bankton. They bowed
slightly to each other and parted. Mrs Stevanson watched
Mrs Bankton as she walked across the room with her party.
She looked very exotic in a short black lace dress and a red
rose in her hair. What slim ankles, thought Mrs Stevanson
disagreeably, thinking of her own heavy legs, practical legs
one artist had told her, voluptuous legs an even better artist
had said.</p>

<p>Mrs Stevanson turned, setting a smile on her lips. She
faced the largest of all the groups: over twenty people talking
all at once to each other. Holding her breasts high she
approached them and, as she was recognized, their voices
lowered and smiles appeared all about her and she was accepted
into the center of the group and there devoured.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Robert Holton was received by a butler. His coat was
taken with ceremony and he was moved easily out of the
black marble foyer into the drawing room.</p>

<p>He had never visited Mrs Stevanson in her New York
apartment. He was greatly impressed and he tried to retain
a mental image of what he saw: he was constructing a dream
world and such an apartment might be material for it.</p>

<p>The drawing room was large, formal and very light. Three
chandeliers hung from the high ceiling. The walls were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
paneled in white wood with gold-leaf decorations, like the
palace at Versailles. Paintings hung at regular intervals
about the room: portraits mostly, portraits of Mrs Stevanson.
There was one large painting of a countryside which
Robert Holton could tell immediately was done by Rembrandt
or someone like him.</p>

<p>The floor was thickly carpeted and tables and formal
chairs furnished the room. A few people sat; most of them,
however, preferred to stand, to move about gracefully,
searching.</p>

<p>He stood blinking in the light, drugged by the high noise
of voices, hypnotized by the odor of many flowers drenched
over the women who stood talking to men.</p>

<p>He walked slowly, uncertainly toward the center of the
room. He knew no one in the room. He looked for familiar
faces, though; there were none. Then he saw Mrs Stevanson
and he walked toward her. She looked at him and he could
tell she was puzzled. Then she recognized him; she came
toward him and they met beneath a portrait of her holding
lilies.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre little Bob Holton, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù A strange description,
he thought.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, Mrs Stevanson, you remember we met last year
and....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOf course we did. How <em>is</em> your father?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúFine, just fine.‚Äù His father hated her.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad to hear that. I think you look more like your
mother, you know. She was such a lovely woman.‚Äù</p>

<p>He mumbled thank you.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYour mother was one of the most charming women I ever
knew. She had such a wonderful way of doing things, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
original.‚Äù Like marrying my father, thought Holton. ‚ÄúShe
was always full of surprises. I used to enjoy her so much.‚Äù</p>

<p>There was an awkward silence. Robert Holton never found
it easy to talk about his mother and Mrs Stevanson had decided,
obviously, that it was the only thing she could discuss
with him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt was very nice of you...‚Äù began Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThink nothing of it, my dear. I don‚Äôt know if there are
many younger people here. You might look round, though.
I suppose you‚Äôll know everybody. There‚Äôs Laura Whitner
over there.... You know her of course.‚Äù He looked and saw
a dark little woman wearing a skull cap.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen her act,‚Äù he said accurately.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, yes.‚Äù Mrs Stevanson looked around the room. He
could see that she was preparing to leave him alone.</p>

<p>He was wrong. ‚ÄúYou must,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúmeet some friends
of mine. They‚Äôre foreigners and they‚Äôve only just arrived.
They don‚Äôt know anyone....‚Äù She was going to say ‚Äúeither‚Äù
but did not.</p>

<p>She led him over to a small group of men and women.
Mrs Stevanson didn‚Äôt know their names but she acted as if
they were her dearest friends.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis young man is Robert Holton. His mother was a
great friend of mine and you must be nice to him.‚Äù She was
cute. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just gotten out of the navy.‚Äù She looked up suddenly
with a magnificent gesture, looked as if someone had
hailed her from across the room. ‚ÄúOh, I have to go! Please
excuse me.‚Äù She moved away in a swirl of silk, her bright
blue hair bouncing on the back of her thick white neck.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow do you do,‚Äù said Holton, shaking hands with a dark
man. Then he shook hands with a light man, with a short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
heavy one, with a thin blonde girl and finally he shook hands
with Mrs Bankton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow do you do,‚Äù said Robert Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow do <em>you</em> do,‚Äù said Mrs Bankton. Her voice startled
him. It was deep and foreign and she had said the ‚Äúyou‚Äù as
though she had really meant him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm very well,‚Äù he said and he looked at her. Her hair
was dark. Her eyes were greenish and bright and shining.
He looked at her mouth, red and curved, elfinly shaped. He
stammered, ‚ÄúI know you. I know you but....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut who am I?‚Äù She laughed and gestured with her long
white hands.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, who are you?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúCarla.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo!‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôve changed. I....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd so have you. I think you look younger out of uniform.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre surprised to see me? I‚Äôm just visiting this country.
My husband,‚Äù she paused, ‚Äúmy husband is in England and
I think he‚Äôll be coming to join me soon.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThen you‚Äôre married?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut of course! And very well.‚Äù She smiled at him, smiled
gently and he felt embarrassed because she acknowledged
an old relationship so easily; that she was so unmoved, so
unguilty.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm very happy to hear that.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt know what else
to say.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThank you. Let‚Äôs get out of this crowd.‚Äù She looked about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
her. She pointed to a corner of the room, an alcove containing
a window. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go over there.‚Äù They walked through
the crowd and sat down on the love seat beneath the window.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre surprised, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù She spoke softly.</p>

<p>‚ÄúA little, I guess. I don‚Äôt know. I have to get used to the idea.
I always associated you with ... with Florence and....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou felt that was behind you?‚Äù</p>

<p>He was surprised. She must have known him very well,
he thought suddenly; he had forgotten how well she had
known him. ‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt think that,‚Äù he lied.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI have very warm memories,‚Äù she said lightly.</p>

<p>He blushed and hated himself but there was nothing he
could do or say that would make it better. ‚ÄúMine were pleasant,
too. I ... I liked Florence quite a bit.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm sure you did, and you liked Fiesole, and the
nights and summer days. I suppose you liked them all.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI liked them all.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd that was what you liked, all that you can remember?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, I <em>remember</em> more. I ... I didn‚Äôt know if you‚Äôd want
to talk about that; being married and....‚Äù</p>

<p>She was surprised. ‚ÄúBut I knew you first, after all. That
counts for something and then I remembered, too. It hasn‚Äôt
been so long.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSeveral years.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt seem that long to me. You remember those
nights at our place in Fiesole? We used to go out and sit on
the ledge and look at the lights of the city.‚Äù They both
looked out the window then, looked at the glacier-bright
squares of light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúIt was very pretty.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou Anglo-Saxon!‚Äù She laughed at him, not maliciously
but gaily. ‚ÄúYou say it‚Äôs pretty. You say it‚Äôs nice. It was beautiful
and you know it. That was a beautiful time.‚Äù</p>

<p>He felt her warmth suddenly, began to remember her
warmth, began to remember much that he had forgotten.
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said he, warmed by her, ‚Äúthose nights <em>were</em> beautiful.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood, I wanted to hear you say that. I wanted you to
say,‚Äù her voice became so low that he could barely hear her,
‚ÄúI wanted you to say much more but I think you‚Äôve forgotten.‚Äù
She looked out at the towers of the city, at the glittering
webs of light. She was embarrassed now and he was
not. No, she was not embarrassed; he realized that with a
sudden vision; she was sad and he didn‚Äôt want her to be
sad.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou know ... I can say more. I didn‚Äôt think you wanted
to hear it. That was so long ago. You‚Äôre married and....‚Äù</p>

<p>She turned around and faced him, her face alive and gay;
her moods changed so quickly, he remembered: he had always
been baffled by her changes. ‚ÄúYou got interested in
someone else. I know what you soldiers are like. Italians are
just the same in Italy.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, there isn‚Äôt anyone else.‚Äù This was the wrong thing
to say and he tried to withdraw the words from the air but
they were lost to him now.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo one else? No one...?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow strange.‚Äù She looked at a painting of Mrs Stevanson
and at that moment she looked as if this painting were
the most important thing to her. Finally she said, ‚ÄúI think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
I‚Äôd like to drink some whiskey. Shall we go to the bar?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúCertainly, Carla.‚Äù He was glad that he had said her
name naturally.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Carla felt uncertain. The cold glass that a footman had
given her was chilling her hand. She wondered if she should
put it down on the dining-room table. They were standing
near it and Robert Holton was looking hungrily at the food;
she could see that in a moment he would have enough courage
to eat.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat a dreadful room,‚Äù said Carla.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù He looked at her as though she had not been
there. ‚ÄúOh, yes, it‚Äôs sort of forbidding.‚Äù He glanced at the
dark wood-paneled walls and the ornate chandelier.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why these people must have everything so
heavy inside,‚Äù said Carla. ‚ÄúThe buildings in New York are
so tall and light.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSome places are more modern.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI suppose they are.‚Äù The glass of whiskey in her hand
was becoming much too cold to hold. She put it down on the
table.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt like it?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think I‚Äôve had enough for now. You remember how
little I used to drink.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, you never needed it.‚Äù He looked at her directly and
smiled. She was happy then because it was the first time he
had looked at her eyes. He was losing his fear of her, this
strange and, to her, inexplicable fear.</p>

<p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs find some place to sit down,‚Äù she said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI thought you wanted to walk around.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>She laughed. ‚ÄúAll right, we‚Äôll do both.‚Äù They walked
around.</p>

<p>More people had arrived. Several hundred, thought Carla
with distaste. She liked smaller parties. She had only come
tonight because friends of her husband had insisted. They
were keeping close watch over her for they knew how jealous
Bankton was. It was very amusing, she thought as she
and Holton walked from group to group. Her husband‚Äôs
friends watching her now would never suspect what had
happened in Florence.</p>

<p>They came to an especially large group, a dozen men surrounding
Laura Whitner.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDo you want to meet her?‚Äù asked Carla, looking at Holton,
knowing that he did.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know her?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut of course. I know everyone.‚Äù</p>

<p>They cut their way through the bewitched men, cut
through to the enchantress herself.</p>

<p>Laura Whitner was dark and slight with full breasts. Her
face was as delicate as a carving in ivory; sallow, too, as old
ivory. The lips were brilliant red and she twisted her mouth
in childlike expressions and her sad dark eyes glittered
from habit and not from fire. She looked unwell, thought
Carla.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCarla Bruno!‚Äù exclaimed Laura when she saw them. The
two women embraced with warmth and the enchantment
was broken for the admirers and they began to withdraw
from the circle of her spell, smiling as they departed, leaving
her alone in her theater with only two admirers.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut my tiny Carla, what are you doing in New York? I
haven‚Äôt seen you for years, not since Paris.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm here visiting.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm so happy to see you! You know, you‚Äôre the last
person I‚Äôd expect to run into here.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI had to get away from Europe. I hadn‚Äôt been to America
since I was a child.‚Äù</p>

<p>Laura Whitner looked at her hands. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not married,
are you?‚Äù Carla wore no wedding ring.</p>

<p>Carla smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>Laura looked astonished, her scarlet mouth, like a wicked
child‚Äôs, twisted with all the emotions she felt and several
that she did not. ‚ÄúTo whom? To the little one here?‚Äù She
motioned to Robert Holton who had been standing silently
watching her.</p>

<p>Carla laughed. ‚ÄúNo, Laura, to Bankton in England.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe painter?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe painter. We‚Äôve been married two years.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAre you happy?‚Äù There was a dark note in her voice as
she said this and Carla could tell that it was something she
wanted to know.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI am not unhappy,‚Äù said Carla, knowing that this was no
answer but she hoped that Holton would grasp her meaning.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù said Laura Whitner almost undramatically. ‚ÄúI
married again, you know.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI heard you did. Is he here tonight? I used to know
him.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHe couldn‚Äôt come, he‚Äôs working on a show. Are you going
to have children?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI want one.‚Äù She sighed and touched the skullcap on her
head with a hand that was pale and like the claw of a bird,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
a hand that shook. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm not too old I‚Äôm going to make a
child. I think that‚Äôs what I need.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou must be very happy with him.‚Äù</p>

<p>She nodded and said with great sincerity, ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm very
happy now. After a long time I am.‚Äù And Carla looked into
her sad dark eyes and saw that they had not changed expression.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù asked Laura Whitner, turning to Holton,
making love to him automatically with her face.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis,‚Äù said Carla, ‚Äúis Robert Holton, an old friend of
mine. We knew each other in Florence during the war.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIndeed!‚Äù She lifted her thin brows and made her mouth
very round. Holton blushed and Carla wanted to protect
him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm very pleased to meet you,‚Äù said Holton awkwardly.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve liked you in the movies.‚Äù Carla remembered then his
honesty: the thing that had attracted her to him. He had
always been honest; she wondered if that was so now.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHave you really, child? Thank you.‚Äù She made a gesture
that was intended for an entire audience but it was still very
graceful.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou must,‚Äù said Carla, ‚Äúcall me up and we‚Äôll get together.
I‚Äôm staying at the Mason.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI shall, of course. Tell me....‚Äù At this moment Mrs Raymond
Stevanson appeared to capture Laura.</p>

<p>‚ÄúLaura, darling, I‚Äôve got the most marvelous Estonian who
wants to meet you. I think he said he was an Estonian. I
know you‚Äôll love him. You‚Äôll excuse me, I know.‚Äù She said
this last to Carla and Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have lunch,‚Äù said Laura, calling back over her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
shoulder as she was borne away by the conquering Mrs
Stevanson.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat did you think of her, Bob?‚Äù asked Carla.</p>

<p>‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not as pretty as I thought she‚Äôd be.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThey never are; you must learn that.‚Äù</p>

<p>He looked at her and she tried to tell what he was thinking
but for once her intuition was not enough: she had first
to examine the years that had gone by. She had to find some
trace of familiar emotion in him. She had to rediscover the
stranger. She had to make him remember what she remembered.
In Florence he had loved her, she was sure of that.
Now it was up to her to reconstruct a passion that had
never been wholly lost. She had cared more for him than he
had known then; would ever know, she hoped. There had
been so many nights after he had left when she had longed
to be with him, nights when she could feel again the warm
summer about them as they lay together in the wide bed in
her room. She was determined now to find the lover in the
stranger that stood beside her, who stood looking seriously
but remotely into her face.</p>

<p>‚ÄúShall we sit down now, Bob?‚Äù</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>People were beginning to leave. It was eight-thirty and
Mrs Stevanson was glad to see them go. The first two hours
were interesting and then she found herself bored.</p>

<p>On the other hand George <em>Robert</em> Lewis was not bored.
He was slightly drunk and enjoying himself very much. He
was usually overcome by a monstrous <em>ennui</em> during the day
which, as evening came, grew less and less. In a few more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
hours he would have discovered a reason for living and this
would keep him happy until he woke up the next morning
with a hang-over.</p>

<p>He was glad when he heard that the famous Bankton‚Äôs
wife was at the party. She had been pointed out to him but
he hadn‚Äôt met her yet. He stopped a waiter and took a cocktail
from him. And, equipped for conversation with a woman,
he marched across the drawing room to where Carla stood
talking with a young man, a rather nice young man, thought
Lewis.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMrs Bankton?‚Äù</p>

<p>She turned and looked at him and he rather liked her
brown-green eyes.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes?‚Äù She looked at him as though she wanted him to go
away. Lewis was sensitive to such things but not particularly
nonplussed; in fact he was accustomed to being asked
to go away.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm George <em>Robert</em> Lewis ... you know <cite>Regarde</cite>, the
<em>avant garde</em> magazine, only it‚Äôs so trite now to call anything
<em>avant garde</em>. You must have seen it. We did the most splendid
article on Bankton last year. I‚Äôve just loved his work because
I can feel what he‚Äôs trying to do: post-surrealism and
all that sort of thing. I‚Äôm all for it; in fact, we‚Äôre all for
people like Bankton who do things. I just felt I couldn‚Äôt help
but come over and say hello.‚Äù</p>

<p>She smiled at him very nicely. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard of you, Mr
Lewis. My husband thinks very highly of what your magazine
is doing.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHe does? Oh, but isn‚Äôt that simply marvelous! I always
felt I would be most sympathetic with the great Bankton.
Tell me, darling, when do you expect him in this country?‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>She took the ‚Äúdarling‚Äù quite well, he thought.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure. I think in a month or so. He‚Äôs so busy in
London.‚Äù ‚ÄúBy the way‚Äù, she said, ‚ÄúI want you to meet an old
friend of mine, Robert Holton.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúVery pleased to meet you, Mr Lewis,‚Äù said the young
man as they shook hands.</p>

<p>‚Äú<i>Enchant√©</i>,‚Äù said Lewis, bowing from the waist and allowing
his hand to stay too long in Holton‚Äôs. Such a nice young
man, thought Lewis, and wondered if....</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat,‚Äù said Carla, ‚Äúis <em>Regarde</em> espousing now?‚Äù She
spoke quickly and Lewis could see that she understood him
and this pleased him although, in a sense, they were rivals.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAs always: the advanced, the revolutionary....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd the honest?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut of course, darling, we are never consciously dishonest,
though it <em>is</em> hard sometimes not being.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúPerhaps in life but not in art.‚Äù She spoke severely. She
was a Latin; he could tell now from her accent.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not English?‚Äù He changed the subject.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm a Florentine.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut how charming! I have always loved Florence. I spent
several summers there when I was a boy. Let me see ... I
was there last in 19.... It‚Äôs not important. How I loved
those doors, though!‚Äù</p>

<p>He saw that the young man named Robert Holton was
beginning to look bored and Lewis hated above all else to
be thought a bore even by a bore.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd <em>you</em> have been to Florence?‚Äù</p>

<p>Holton nodded.</p>

<p>Carla said, ‚ÄúThat was where we met the first time. He‚Äôs an
old friend of our family‚Äôs.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúHow droll that must‚Äôve been for you, finding this charming
boy here at Helena Stevanson‚Äôs who, though I love her
dearly, gives the dullest parties in New York.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThey <em>are</em> dull. I wonder why people come. Why do you
come?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm a creature in constant need of companionship. I go
to everything. I <em>must</em> see a lot of people or I become most
dreadfully morbid and then I write poems.‚Äù</p>

<p>She smiled. ‚ÄúI remember you used to write some good
poems.‚Äù</p>

<p>He laughed, pleased. ‚ÄúYou remember then? That was so
long ago. I somehow have gotten all out of the habit.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúPerhaps you see too many people.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat may be right and, speaking of people, you lovely
ones must have dinner with me this evening, otherwise I
must eat alone; I‚Äôve been deserted today by everyone.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid,‚Äù said Carla, ‚Äúthat we can‚Äôt....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a bad idea,‚Äù said Holton much to Lewis‚Äôs surprise&mdash;to
Carla‚Äôs surprise, too. Lewis looked at her and saw
she was surprised. He was amused, wickedly amused. There
was something between them.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou must really join me. I know of the most interesting
place in the Village. I know you‚Äôll love it.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want to go?‚Äù asked Holton, looking at Carla.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy....‚Äù She didn‚Äôt know what to say.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCertainly you‚Äôll come; three is good company.‚Äù</p>

<p>Carla gestured uncertainly with her hands.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPerhaps I‚Äôd better come back in a moment,‚Äù said Lewis,
smiling maliciously at Carla. ‚ÄúI so hope I‚Äôm not upsetting
plans.‚Äù He made bowing movements and retreated into the
center of the party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>As he withdrew he could see the long look Carla gave the
young man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The men from Wall Street bored Mr Heywood. He tried
to act like them but from time to time he could not help implying
gently to them that he was a broker through heredity,
not inclination. It was so much easier doing what his father
had done than to do something else or nothing at all. He
had a puritanical horror of doing nothing. His family had
made him believe that it was necessary always to work and
he rather liked the work, too. It made him think less about
his own uniquely miserable life.</p>

<p>His wives were a large part of the general dreariness of his
life. He never seemed to marry the right women. They either
wanted his money or wanted to dominate him. He was used
to domination by now but it made him uneasy sometimes to
feel that his own will was so easily bent by others. He was
always making stands, erecting firm barriers, but somehow
the barriers usually collapsed. He wondered sometimes if he
shouldn‚Äôt collect stamps or have a hobby like that.</p>

<p>Thinking of this, he began now to divorce himself from
the group of Wall Street people. He promised to have lunch
with one, to call up another; he bowed to a third, shook
hands with a fourth and then he floated softly away, a look
of quiet happiness on his face: he was now alone in the
midst of a party.</p>

<p>Mr Heywood looked about him to see if there was anyone
he might like to talk to. He would prefer some young woman
who looked lonely. His three wives had all looked lonely at
one period of the courtship and he had married them as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
much for this corresponding loneliness as for anything else.
He had been mistaken three times but he was, in general,
an optimist.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no lonely-looking young women. He
sighed and was about to leave the party when he saw Robert
Holton. He remembered him clearly; he was proud of his
memory. Now he would have to speak to him. It would be
difficult, but then he had always been taught that if a thing
was particularly unpleasant it should be done: character was
made in this fashion and character was more important than
anything else. He proceeded to mould his character. He
walked toward Robert Holton.</p>

<p>Mr Heywood approached Holton from behind and he
could overhear his conversation with a dark pretty woman.</p>

<p>Holton was saying, ‚ÄúI think it might be interesting. After
all, Carla, I don‚Äôt get out much and if a person like Lewis
wants us to go I think we should.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIf you want to, Bob.‚Äù She was a foreigner, thought Mr
Heywood with interest. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd hoped we might have had dinner
together and try to ... to talk of.... I‚Äôm not saying this
well, I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, Carla....‚Äù Mr Heywood drifted between them now.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMr Holton?‚Äù he asked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, Mr Heywood! How do you do, sir?‚Äù Robert Holton
was impressed as always with Mr Heywood‚Äôs greatness and
this both saddened and pleased Mr Heywood.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI had thought ...‚Äù began Mr Heywood in a barely audible
voice.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis,‚Äù said Holton quickly on top of Mr Heywood‚Äôs
words, ‚Äúis Mrs Bankton, an old friend of mine. Mr Heywood.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>The meeting was made and Mr Heywood was rather attracted
to this pretty girl who spoke English so beautifully
and yet with an accent.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI thought I should find you here, Mr Holton. Mrs Stevanson
was telling me about you.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat was nice of her.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúShe is a charming woman,‚Äù said Mr Heywood, praising
an absent person about whom they all cared very little; it
filled the first awkwardness of a meeting such as this. ‚ÄúYou
enjoy being downtown?‚Äù He was careful not to associate
himself with Holton‚Äôs job.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, very much,‚Äù said Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBy the way,‚Äù asked the dark pretty woman, ‚Äúwhat are
you doing now? You haven‚Äôt told me.‚Äù</p>

<p>Holton flushed and Mr Heywood was sorry for him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm
working in a brokerage office.‚Äù</p>

<p>She laughed. ‚ÄúBut how dreadful that must be.‚Äù</p>

<p>Holton looked miserable and Mr Heywood, who rather
agreed with her, laughed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not too terrible, Mrs Bankton.
Some of us manage to survive it. I think a sense of humor is
the most important thing.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI had no idea you were also in the
same situation.‚Äù</p>

<p>How delightful she was, thought Mr Heywood. ‚ÄúWe
must all,‚Äù said Mr Heywood in a voice that was like the sigh
of a dying man, ‚Äúdo our appointed tasks. Duty is of such
great importance: it is the only tangible thing in the chaos
of living.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs so at all,‚Äù said Carla as gently as
he but with less resignation. ‚ÄúOne should always try to do
what one wants to do.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúIn spite of one‚Äôs duty to others?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúPeople that you love?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, that I ... that one admires and respects.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd this makes you happy?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAre any of us happy?‚Äù asked Heywood in a voice of
weary sadness; he stopped, suddenly remembering that
young Holton was there. It would never do for him to hear
these things.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI talked,‚Äù he said casually, ‚Äúwith Murphy about you today.
He seemed most enthusiastic.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nice. I like working with him.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúPerhaps,‚Äù said Mr Heywood, looking at a spot somewhere
over Holton‚Äôs head, ‚Äúperhaps you would be interested in
working in the jobs that, ah, come in contact with the public.‚Äù
He could not say selling: he tried but he could not. He
wondered if maybe a long trip to South America would give
him a new perspective.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think that would be wonderful!‚Äù Holton was moved as
he should be. An affable young man, thought Mr Heywood
who, as a rule, did not like men at all, especially
young men who seemed to be able to get all the lonely
young women they wanted.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPerhaps,‚Äù murmured Mr Heywood, ‚Äúsomething can be
arranged in the near future.‚Äù He looked at the dark woman
beside Holton and he thought her an unusually real person
to find in such a place as this. She was probably not real,
though: only an illusion with long white hands and silvery
nails. He was used to women vanishing.</p>

<p>George <em>Robert</em> Lewis appeared and Mr Heywood experienced
a slight spasm of nausea. He found Lewis hard to be
with. Mr Heywood would not have said that being a broker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
was a productive life but if, to be an artist, it was necessary
to be like Lewis he had no desire to be an artist.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow do you do?‚Äù said Lewis, bowing very low and
smirking at him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd how are you?‚Äù inquired Mr Heywood politely, beginning
to retreat slowly.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDoing marvelously. These charming people here are dining
with me, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù</p>

<p>Carla looked uncertain and Holton nodded. Mr Heywood
wondered where Holton had run across Lewis.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm really,‚Äù said Lewis in a conspiratorial voice (an old
woman‚Äôs voice, thought Mr Heywood, frowning slightly),
‚Äújust doing a job. Her husband is one of our idols and I may
get a perfectly marvelous essay out of her. I knew his work
so well.‚Äù Mr Heywood wondered vaguely why Lewis was
explaining so many things.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI see,‚Äù said Mr Heywood. He turned to Carla. ‚ÄúDelighted
to have met you.‚Äù He nodded to Holton. ‚ÄúI shall probably
see you tomorrow.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, sir; good night, sir.‚Äù Mr Heywood glided away toward
the door.</p>

<p>Mrs Stevanson appeared beside him just as he had made
up his mind to leave.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDo cheer up, Heywood. You look so petulant!‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really, Helena, not really.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not so sure. Who‚Äôre you looking at?‚Äù He glanced
away quickly but she saw that he had been watching Carla.
‚ÄúLovely, isn‚Äôt she? I‚Äôm afraid she‚Äôs stuck with that Holton
boy and, my Lord, George <em>Robert‚Äôs</em> got her, too. The poor
child and...‚Äù Mrs Stevanson was surprised. ‚ÄúI do think
they‚Äôre leaving!‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúAfter all,‚Äù said Heywood soothingly, ‚Äúit <em>is</em> a cocktail
party. They probably weren‚Äôt able to find you.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI suppose you‚Äôre right, Heywood. Manners change so.
She looked rather unhappy, I thought.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWho?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúMrs. Bankton.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúReally. I didn‚Äôt notice.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt suppose you did; men don‚Äôt notice very many
things anyway,‚Äù said Mrs Stevanson, suddenly exhibiting
her bitterness. She controlled herself quickly. ‚ÄúExcept men
like you, Heywood dear.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThank you, Helena.‚Äù He bowed without movement; he
suggested a bow without actually executing it. ‚ÄúNow I must
really be going.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSo soon, Heywood, so soon?‚Äù</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><em>Chapter Ten</em></h2>
</div>


<p class="p2">Carla was angry with Robert Holton, angrier still with
George <em>Robert</em> Lewis. She had hoped to have dinner alone
with Holton. She wanted time to recover a past emotion and
now she would have very little time. As they drove through
the lighted streets she looked with dislike at Lewis‚Äôs smooth
boyish face.</p>

<p>None of them spoke after they got into the cab outside
Mrs Stevanson‚Äôs place. Lewis had given the driver an address
and they had relaxed, each thinking of different
things: Holton pleased to be seeing life; Lewis pleased to
have secured the wife of a great figure; Carla displeased
with the arrangement, Carla plotting murder.</p>

<p>Robert Holton sat in the middle. Carla had decided that
if she had to spend an evening with Lewis she at least
wouldn‚Äôt sit next to him.</p>

<p>She looked at Holton as they drove down Seventh Avenue.
He was looking straight ahead. His well-formed, not
very strong mouth was set in a straight line; he was trying
to be firm now; he was trying to convince her that he was
right in accepting Lewis‚Äôs invitation for them.</p>

<p>She sighed loudly so that she would be heard and understood.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
Then she looked out the window and examined the
neon signs that broke the darkness with many colors. She
liked the lights.</p>

<p>The taxicab stopped on a side street where a dozen or
more signs advertised night clubs. They got out and Lewis
paid the driver.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhere is it?‚Äù asked Holton, looking about him.</p>

<p>Lewis pointed to some steps. ‚ÄúRight down there. I suppose
it‚Äôs open; you know, there was some talk that the
police might close it but I don‚Äôt think they will. Shall we
go in?‚Äù</p>

<p>Carla could see that Holton was wondering what he
meant when he said that the police might close it. She understood
herself and she was rather pleased now: it would
be a lesson for him, an experience that he needed.</p>

<p>Lewis led them down the steps and into the night club.</p>

<p>There were two large rooms: one light and garish, with a
long bar, many mirrors and booths; the other was darker,
with tables and, at one end, a small band on a small stage.
They went into the darker room. The headwaiter recognized
Lewis and was very polite to him; he showed them to a
table near the stage.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this charming?‚Äù asked Lewis. ‚ÄúI think it has a wonderful
atmosphere.‚Äù He grinned at Carla. She nodded.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not too garish,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo many American places
are too light.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúDo they have a floor show?‚Äù asked Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúA very unusual one,‚Äù said Lewis, giggling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure
you‚Äôll think it great fun. Hermes de Bianca is the star of the
show and his dance is perfectly magnificent. He is one of the
great artists, great interpretive artists, I mean.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúIs that right?‚Äù</p>

<p>A waiter came to take their order. He was a curious-looking
waiter, a type which Carla recognized but Holton
did not. He wore no uniform. She looked around the room
and found that none of the others wore uniforms. They were
dressed casually. This waiter‚Äôs hair was long, unpleasantly
long and the front of it had been carefully bleached. He was
thin and moved stiffly, self-consciously, like a woman thinking
of rape. On one of his fingers he wore a large ring with
a bizarre stone in it.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat do you people want?‚Äù His voice was irritable and
high. He was looking interestedly at Holton who was looking
just as interestedly at him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôd love something to drink,‚Äù said Lewis. ‚ÄúHow about the
rest of you?‚Äù</p>

<p>The waiter looked at Lewis for the first time. His face
brightened. ‚ÄúGeorge, it‚Äôs you! How lovely to see you! You
haven‚Äôt been here in such a long time.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve been dreadfully busy,‚Äù said Lewis coldly, disengaging
himself from the waiter‚Äôs assumed relationship.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think,‚Äù said Holton, ‚Äúthat I‚Äôd like a highball.‚Äù They all
decided to have the same thing and the waiter, with a slight
toss of his head, walked away.</p>

<p>The small band was playing loudly and eagerly. One sentimental
modern song after another was catapulted into the
room. Fortunately, after several minutes the band stopped
playing and the musicians departed.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre gone,‚Äù said Carla. ‚ÄúThey make too much
music.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt very delicate.‚Äù Lewis turned suddenly to
Holton. ‚ÄúAnd you, what do you do?‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>Holton flushed. ‚ÄúWell, I work in a brokerage house.‚Äù</p>

<p>Lewis‚Äôs eyebrows went up and he elaborately showed surprise
and disbelief. ‚ÄúBut how remarkable! You‚Äôre not an
artist! Surely you must do something wonderful. You have
the hands of an artist. You‚Äôre just working there because
you have to. That‚Äôs it, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs not it.‚Äù Carla admired his courage. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt
mind working there and it‚Äôs probably going to be my career.‚Äù
His jaw got very firm. She liked him this way.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow marvelous!‚Äù exclaimed Lewis. ‚ÄúA contented Babbitt.‚Äù
He stopped. ‚ÄúWhat a dreadful thing to say: that‚Äôs such
a Nineteen-Twenty phrase. Really, I sometimes wonder if art
is the answer to our problems.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think it might be to the artist,‚Äù said Carla softly.</p>

<p>Lewis bowed. ‚Äú<em>Touch√©</em>, my dear. Let‚Äôs say the dedication
to art, the freedom from conventions. Perhaps this young
man‚Äôs view is the saner: to accept the pattern.‚Äù He was
mocking now but he did not show it in his face.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSome things you have to accept,‚Äù said Holton, aware of
Lewis‚Äôs mockery. ‚ÄúSometimes there is nothing else.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThere is always something else,‚Äù said Lewis decidedly.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs right,‚Äù said Carla.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù asked Holton. ‚ÄúWhat else can you do but that?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúRun away,‚Äù said Lewis.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFall in love,‚Äù said Carla.</p>

<p>But neither solution was convincing to Holton and Carla
could think of no way to explain herself. There seemed, at
the moment, no words to record her meaning, no bridge to
reach him. They were all three quiet, thinking of questions
and answers.</p>

<p>Finally their silence killed the problem and they began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
to notice the room they were in and the other people. The
people at the different tables were not, generally, mixed.
Several women would sit at one table and several men would
sit at another. Around the room were small tables for two
and here men sat with men and women with women. This
was puzzling to Holton, she could see. He said nothing,
though, and she had a great sudden ache of tenderness for
him, a desire to protect his innocence. But this she could not
do. She was a stranger to him and he had forgotten.</p>

<p>Cigarette smoke veiled the room bluely and everything
seemed tenuous and unreal. The sound of voices and ice
clattering, of forks striking plates and of many people moving
and breathing together made an ocean-like roar in
Carla‚Äôs ears. The room was hot and the smell of perfume was
strong.</p>

<p>The band returned and began to play. They played much
more softly than they had before and she was grateful. Conversation
was not difficult when the music was soft. In fact,
the music seemed to underline many things, made emotional
statements dramatic. Unfortunately, with George <em>Robert</em>
Lewis sitting at the table there was no opportunity to make
emotional statements. He would have to leave. She began
to concentrate on this as they talked now of trivial things.
Finally he received her subconscious message. He stood up.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôll excuse me a moment but I have to go backstage.
I‚Äôll only be gone a minute.‚Äù He left quickly, going
around the stage and behind the crimson curtain.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a funny little queer, isn‚Äôt he?‚Äù commented Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs one of the great aesthetes. You‚Äôre glad you came tonight?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting,‚Äù he said. He was defending himself now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúThis is a very ...‚Äù she paused, trying to think of the right
word, ‚Äútrivial world. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll like it.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúPerhaps I will. I used to be something of a sculptor.‚Äù He
said this laughing, and she could see that he was quite
serious.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThen why don‚Äôt you do it?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt good enough. I haven‚Äôt done any since I was in
college.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWould you like to do it?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù She couldn‚Äôt tell whether he meant this
or not.</p>

<p>The waiter came and put their glasses down on the table
with a look of boredom; in fact, he yawned slightly as he did
it. He tried to catch Holton‚Äôs eye but failed. Sulkily he
walked away.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want this,‚Äù said Carla, pointing to the glass.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll take it,‚Äù said Holton and he began to drink his own,
his teeth making clicking sounds as the ice bobbed against
them.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou like what you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù asked Carla.</p>

<p>He put the glass down and frowned. ‚ÄúI suppose I do. I
have to do it and so I figure I might as well like it.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúPerhaps you might find something you like better.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou might be a sculptor again.‚Äù</p>

<p>He laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really no good. I can‚Äôt do anything else
but this. I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with what I‚Äôm doing,
anyway.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing wrong with it if you‚Äôre happy; are you?‚Äù
He didn‚Äôt answer for a moment. Then he said, ‚ÄúI suppose
I am.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre not in love?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat has that to do with it?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSo many things,‚Äù said Carla, and she did not look at him;
she avoided his eyes. He did not understand. She could see
that now. The desire, however, to make him destroy his barriers,
to come alive, was becoming an obsession with her.
And then, of course, he had been the first man she had
known and that made him important to her. She had never
lost her feeling for him and she was sad to see him confused;
Carla thought of herself as Joan of Arc: helping the
king to his throne. She was not yet sure, however, that the
king wished to reign.</p>

<p>The music was becoming soft and sentimental. Full round
chords gushed around them and people danced on the stage.
Men danced with women and women with men for there
was not really much courage among these people.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWould you like to dance?‚Äù asked Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNot right now.‚Äù</p>

<p>He was not disappointed. She watched him as he watched
the other people in the room. This was something new for
him. She guessed that he was shocked by the people he saw
at the different tables. He showed nothing in his face,
though. Perhaps he did not recognize them, did not know
them the way she did: she who had married one of them.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been quite a while, hasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù said Holton finally.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, but I haven‚Äôt forgotten any of it, have you?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOf course not. Naturally I didn‚Äôt know whether you
wanted to talk about it. I figured that ... well, after you
married Bankton you wouldn‚Äôt want to think about what
we did.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt,‚Äù said Carla, ‚Äúlove Bankton.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>He was shocked and she knew that she had said the right
thing if in the wrong manner.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut you got married,‚Äù said Holton.</p>

<p>She nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I didn‚Äôt know very much about
him then. I went to London after the war was over and I
stayed with some artists there. I met him and he made love
to me. I thought he was very wonderful. I had heard stories
about him: that he was ... was like these people here.‚Äù She
gestured to include the room. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt believe the stories. I
married him. I found he wanted me for camouflage.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you divorce him then?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúPerhaps I shall someday. It seems so much trouble,
though. He‚Äôs really a very nice person.‚Äù</p>

<p>Holton shook his head, confused. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see ... I don‚Äôt
see why he married you in the first place if he was....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHe could still like me, Bob.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see how.‚Äù</p>

<p>She smiled. ‚ÄúIt <em>is</em> hard to explain but anyway you know
now that I don‚Äôt feel too deeply about him. You understand
this?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI suppose so,‚Äù said Robert Holton. He <em>is</em> beginning to
understand, thought Carla, happy now: her words had
begun to build the bridge between them. Soon they would
meet again.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôve certainly had a funny life,‚Äù said Holton, smiling.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSometimes I think so but then the most important thing
is making a freedom for oneself. When that‚Äôs done nothing is
strange because everything is natural. You know what I
mean?‚Äù</p>

<p>He nodded. ‚ÄúSometimes I know.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>She picked up a fork and drew pictures on the white
tablecloth. ‚ÄúI want you to be free,‚Äù she said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúFree from what?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou know. From your routine and morals: the things you
don‚Äôt want.‚Äù</p>

<p>He laughed. ‚ÄúYou know pretty well what my set of morals
is and I don‚Äôt mind the routine so much.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think you do.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy did you want to come here with Lewis tonight?
Why are you with me now?‚Äù</p>

<p>He smiled. ‚ÄúPerhaps you‚Äôre partly right. I was curious and
I do get bored and....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre alone.‚Äù She spoke for him.</p>

<p>He finished his drink and did not answer her; there was
no need to answer her.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAre you glad,‚Äù she asked at last, ‚Äúare you glad to see me
again?‚Äù</p>

<p>He said that he was. He declared that he was. He made
an issue of it. He was still not at ease with her and she felt
desperate. It was like a battle between them; first one side
retreating and the other advancing.... Or perhaps a hunt.
She was the hunter and her memories the pursued. She
knew that beneath his many assumed faces there was the
person she had known in Florence. Deliberately Carla began
to smash the faces.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>George <em>Robert</em> Lewis had a very pleasant interview with
de Bianca, the star; after a half-hour, though, he was beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
to get restless. Dancers seldom talked about anything
interesting. Finally he excused himself, saying that his guests
were waiting for him.</p>

<p>They were talking quietly and intimately when he got
back to the table. He took a secret pleasure in interrupting
them. Lewis had already decided that they were lovers.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm so dreadfully sorry that I went off and left you the
way I did. It was stupid of me but I got so involved with
Hermes and his amours: he tells me all about them and
though they‚Äôre really quite dull I have to be polite and listen.
Have you ordered yet?‚Äù</p>

<p>They said that they had not. Lewis immediately became
noisily efficient. He ordered the languid waiter about, gave
him careful instructions and ignored his glances and meaningful
gestures. Lewis never had liked this type at all. The
ones like this waiter never seemed to have any respect for
him. They couldn‚Äôt understand the principles for which he
stood. They were not artists.</p>

<p>The dinner finally ordered, he turned toward his guests,
a white-toothed smile on his slightly rouged lips (Hermes
had lent him rouge).</p>

<p>‚ÄúAre you adoring the atmosphere, my dear Mrs Bankton?
It‚Äôs nothing to compare with Paris, of course, but you must
admit that it‚Äôs a lot gayer than Rome. I love Rome and usually
have a marvelous time there but somehow one never
seems to find the same easy atmosphere that we have here.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, it is not like Rome,‚Äù agreed Carla. What wonderful
golden skin she has, thought Lewis, enjoying her aesthetically.
He didn‚Äôt dislike women the way many of his friends
did. He felt, in fact, most compatible with them.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAre there many places like this in New York?‚Äù asked Holton.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
Lewis was pleased that he had caught on. Lewis, always
optimistic, wondered if it might not be possible to
make some sort of an arrangement.... It was not impossible,
certainly.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, quite a few, quite a few. They <em>are</em> rather charming
from time to time. I enjoy visiting them and I do feel that
the atmosphere is not uncongenial.‚Äù He wondered if perhaps
he hadn‚Äôt been using the word ‚Äúatmosphere‚Äù too much.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard about these places,‚Äù said Holton without much
expression.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSurely you don‚Äôt disapprove?‚Äù Lewis was intent on discovering
this now. He could see that Carla was uneasy. Holton
was unsatisfactory, though.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care much one way or the other,‚Äù he said and he
turned to Carla and began to talk to her again. Lewis, disappointed,
listened to them as they talked of Fiesole.</p>

<p>Lewis was not quite sure what their relationship was. As
they talked he gathered that she was more interested than
he in continuing it. That was usually the case, however.
Young men like Holton were apt to be a little unfeeling, a
little stuffy. George <em>Robert</em> Lewis thought pleasantly of
young men.</p>

<p>When he felt that they had talked too long without him,
he interrupted. ‚ÄúWhen were you last in Fiesole?‚Äù He looked
at Carla, intending the question for her; it was difficult not
having a name to call her.</p>

<p>She looked at him as though she had forgotten him completely.
‚ÄúIn Fiesole? I was there just a year ago.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI suppose it‚Äôs pretty well recovered from the war. I told
you how I used to love visiting there before the war. I hope
it will always be pleasant.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúI think it will,‚Äù said Carla.</p>

<p>‚ÄúEurope must‚Äôve been very nice before the war,‚Äù said
Holton.</p>

<p>George <em>Robert</em> Lewis made an elaborate motion to show
just what it had been before the war; as he was finishing his
movement the waiter brought them their dinner: a number
of dishes with filet of sole at the center.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI hope you enjoy it,‚Äù said the waiter spitefully, putting
the dishes down loudly and angrily. He walked away, his
duty done.</p>

<p>Lewis sighed. ‚ÄúThese dreadful waiters, they presume so. I
suppose that it‚Äôs all a part of the American dream. Shall we
begin?‚Äù Like a priest of a pagan cult he began to perform
the ritual of arranging plates, of removing covers, of neatly
moving food from plate to plate, and finally of eating. The
others imitated him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhen,‚Äù asked Robert Holton, after the main part of the
dinner had been eaten, ‚Äúwill the show start?‚Äù</p>

<p>Lewis put down his fork carefully, swallowed, and said,
‚ÄúVery soon, I think. What time is it?‚Äù There was an examination
of watches: ten-fifteen. ‚ÄúThe show starts at ten-thirty.
I hope you‚Äôre not impatient. The audience is very often as
interesting as the show. But I must say that de Bianca‚Äôs
dance is in another world and that we mustn‚Äôt miss it. I‚Äôll
be very curious to know how you react.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThere used to be a place in Paris like this where they had
a wonderful dancer of the same type. I suppose he‚Äôs the type
of dancer I think he is?‚Äù said Carla.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHe is quite probably the sort of dancer you think he is,‚Äù
said Lewis, smiling, excluding Holton from his words. ‚ÄúThe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
only difference is that he is a great artist, interpretive artist,
I mean. I know you‚Äôll appreciate him.‚Äù</p>

<p>A group of people who knew Lewis came over to their
table. They acted most respectfully and he hoped that
Carla and Holton were noticing what an important person
he was. He spoke nicely to them, shook hands with them,
and let them know that he was busy. They left him then,
smiling. Smiling himself, he turned to Carla and Holton and
he was disappointed to find them talking together again.
Holton had taken Carla‚Äôs hand in his and Lewis felt a strange
anguish, felt an inward betrayal. He did not know what had
been betrayed, however.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, my dear, that I didn‚Äôt introduce you to those
people. It was rude of me because they <em>all</em> admire your husband‚Äôs
work.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs perfectly all right,‚Äù said Carla. ‚ÄúI know so little
about his work. I‚Äôm only a layman, you know.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI can hardly believe that. You must‚Äôve been an artist
yourself at one time.‚Äù</p>

<p>She shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, I was never an artist at anything.
Except at living, perhaps.‚Äù Trumpets sounded loudly from
the band, giving her statement an absurd grandeur. She
sensed this and laughed. ‚ÄúI wish to say that I try to make
my life a complete thing.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut what a marvelous thing to want to do! All of us try
that but when we fail at it (and alas we most of us fail)
then we must find ourselves a medium to guard our egos, to
protect our fears.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs for the talented, Mr Lewis, but for the rest of us,
the majority, only our lives count. We must make them
natural.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd that,‚Äù said Robert Holton suddenly, ‚Äúis for the rich
to do. The rest of us can‚Äôt even do that.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow delightful!‚Äù exclaimed Lewis. ‚ÄúWe have here the
three representatives of humanity: the rich and ... free?
the poor and trapped, and the artist who is finding both
freedom and an opiate. But how wonderfully symbolic!
We‚Äôre practically an allegory. I suppose we can reach some
understanding.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow?‚Äù asked Holton and Lewis could see that he was
asking Carla, not him. ‚ÄúHow can you get what you want
without money? I don‚Äôt see how you can ever do what you
want if you aren‚Äôt free.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think,‚Äù said Carla, ‚Äúthat you can become free. You can
get free in art and you can get free in love. Money hasn‚Äôt
much to do with it. You can‚Äôt go anywhere alone. I don‚Äôt
think it‚Äôs possible to be sane alone, without love.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre right,‚Äù said Lewis sincerely and sadly, allowing
the now soft music to dissolve his mind into an emotional
waste out of which, of course, came art. ‚ÄúI think you
have explained all the tragedies in the world.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd all the happiness,‚Äù murmured Carla, looking at Holton.
Holton smiled then. It was the first time that Lewis had
seen him smile and he was struck by the gentleness and
beauty of his face. He was beginning to see the person under
the rather rigid mask and he understood now why this quite
wonderful woman was in love. Holton was about to say
something when the band made a crescendo and the lights
on the stage went up. The show was about to begin.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A slender little man, ineptly painted, appeared on the
stage and welcomed the audience to the night club.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>He then motioned and the lights in the room went out
leaving only the stage with its curtain backdrop lighted. The
band began to play a current song and the master of ceremonies
proceeded to sing, using new dirty lyrics which made
the audience laugh. He then told a joke about fairies. The
audience laughed loudly at this, reveling in exposure; often
their masks became too tight, too heavy. He removed them.</p>

<p>Finished with his joke, he bowed and several persons
came onto the stage. They were probably men. They wore
dresses and several of them had faces of great beauty. They
danced, parodying women, transcending the single sex. And
in the audience people looked at one another and nodded
and looked again at the stage, smiles on their faces.</p>

<p>When their dance was finished they left. There was much
noise from the audience.</p>

<p>Then a thin young man swayed onto the stage, took the
microphone in his hands and sang a sexual funny song.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWho is that?‚Äù asked Carla, turning to Lewis.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOur waiter, darling,‚Äù whispered Lewis; ‚Äúall the performers
are waiters, too. Isn‚Äôt it exciting?‚Äù</p>

<p>Carla said nothing. Lewis looked at Holton. There was
little light in the room and he couldn‚Äôt make out his expression.
Holton was sitting motionless, one hand on the table,
one hand touching Carla‚Äôs.</p>

<p>Their waiter was so well received that he sang another
song.</p>

<p>More dancers appeared. This time they were real women
and the men who came out with them were dressed as men.
They did a serious near-ballet but, because they didn‚Äôt know
how to dance very well and because they didn‚Äôt particularly
care, the dance was funny and Holton laughed. Lewis and
Carla didn‚Äôt laugh: for different reasons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly in the middle of the dance a voice off stage announced
loudly, ‚ÄúJerry!‚Äù and a girl dressed in a fake tiger
skin ran onto the stage. The audience whistled and stamped
and a table of girls near the stage applauded hysterically.
The girl‚Äôs face was square and smooth and hard, without expression.
Her body was strong and slim and startlingly
white. One shoulder and most of one breast were bare.</p>

<p>She moved in a stylized jungle fashion among the other
dancers who ran from her, simulating fear as they did.
Finally she was left alone on the stage. She danced then,
showing as much of her hard white body as she could. Her
face never changed expression, however. She always looked
straight ahead without smiling, her square face rigid.</p>

<p>And, at last, as a climax, she unfastened the tiger skin and
with a quick gesture pulled it off and for a moment let the
audience see her white hard body. Then the lights went off
and she disappeared as the women in the audience shrieked
their delight and the men, catching some of the hysteria, applauded
loudly.</p>

<p>The lights came on again and the stage was empty. The
band played uncompelling music. ‚ÄúWhat,‚Äù asked Lewis,
turning to Holton, ‚Äúdid you think of her? Isn‚Äôt she a perfect
savage?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think she is,‚Äù said Holton seriously. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt
think she was good at all, did you?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy, yes, I thought she had something. A certain ...
how shall I say ... banked fire?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI agree with Bob,‚Äù said Carla. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs a savage;
I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs natural.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúJust prejudice,‚Äù said Lewis lightly, gesturing with his
hand. ‚ÄúJust prejudice; anyway, the girls here love her.‚Äù He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
pointed to a table of women. The dancer, wearing a dressing
gown now, was sitting on the lap of one.</p>

<p>Holton chuckled.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat amuses you?‚Äù asked Lewis but Holton wouldn‚Äôt
answer him.</p>

<p>Carla told them of a dancer in Paris, like this dancer, and
as she talked the lights went off in the room and the band
began to play. Suddenly a spotlight was turned upon the
stage and the room became quiet as the people waited to
see the thing they had heard of, the thing they had come to
see.</p>

<p>Softly the orchestra played.</p>

<p>A boy with blond curling hair and a smooth white face
walked onto the stage, turned his back to the audience, and
hung a round silver moon from a hook attached to the low
ceiling. He stood back a moment, looking at the moon, and
then, satisfied that it was right, he stepped off the small
stage and sat down on a bench near the wings.</p>

<p>The silver moon shone dully, dominating the stage and
the room. In the middle of the moon there was a mask: a
painted mask, enticing, sexual, ambiguous, a youth or a
woman. From this mask long veils of pink and blue silk
quivered gently, stirred by the now-excited breathing of the
audience. They watched this mask and, watching, waited for
the dance to begin.</p>

<p>A voice came startlingly into the room from a loud-speaker.
Said the voice: ‚ÄúWe take great pride in introducing the star
of our show, the one and only Hermes de Bianca. To the
music of a Tschaikovsky concerto he will do a dance symbolic
of the struggle between the material and the spiritual
natures of man. Introducing MR HERMES DE BIANCA!‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>The band began to play the concerto. More lights, multicolored
lights, were turned upon the stage. The veils of the
moon fluttered and Hermes de Bianca entered.</p>

<p>A long sigh came from the audience as he appeared and
began to dance.</p>

<p>He wore a thin silk costume, mysterious and black, with
flowing sleeves. He was fat, not grossly fat like a man, but
rather the plump voluptuousness of an old belle; his skin
shone white through the semi-transparent costume.</p>

<p>His hips were heavy and feminine. His hands and feet
were tiny; he was very proud of them, for he gestured with
his hands and pirouetted on the tips of his dainty feet. His
breasts were the breasts of a woman.</p>

<p>Methodically he danced. With an obscene grace he moved
about the stage, moved like a yielding woman exulting in
her passivity.</p>

<p>His face:</p>

<p>There are the faces of men and there are the faces of
women and there are also the faces of children, but this was
yet another face.</p>

<p>The skin was smooth and silken-looking. The face was
beautiful; his eyes were widened with paint and across the
upper eyelids rows of shining, diamond-like stones were
glued, making his slightest expression glitter in the light.</p>

<p>As he danced he would touch his hair from time to time,
using the most common of feminine gestures. His hair was
dark and oiled, with an artificial peak over the forehead.
And, most striking of all, streaks of gray had been painted
at the temples.</p>

<p>The music then became sad and, as it did, his dance became
slower, more sensual. His wide painted mouth was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
never still, always working, always moist, the lips never
without expression; now parted, showing desire, now petulant,
now commanding, always enticing young men to love.</p>

<p>He moved with great lightness, handling his heaviness
gracefully as he advanced upon the moon, making love to
the mask.</p>

<p>Then, as the music became louder, more compelling, he
whirled and twisted among the veils of the moon, wrapping
himself in them, surrendering to the mask, approaching and
retreating, always attracted to the painted mask.</p>

<p>But, finally, he was the one conquered, the one who surrendered,
the passive one. And he stood there, the sounds
of music all about him, engulfing him, his back arched, his
head thrown back and his plump white stomach shuddering
beneath the dark material of his costume.</p>

<p>And then, as the music reached a climax, he whirled in the
center of the stage, violent, obscene in a desire to be possessed.</p>

<p>The music stopped.</p>

<p>There was silence in the room&mdash;no sound save the unheard
thundering of many quick-beating hearts. The ones who understood
were too moved to speak and the ones who did not
understand were embarrassed and sickened, aware of their
danger, and afraid.</p>

<p>He bowed to the audience now, his moist red mouth smiling
brilliantly, the mouth of an actress awaiting applause.
The applause came, destroying the silence in the room, creating
another less frightening mood, replenishing his ego.</p>

<p>Smiling, he walked in triumph off the stage.</p>

<p>The lights were turned on at last and the orchestra played
a popular song.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>The boy took down the silver moon and the painted mask
and as he walked away he took the reality of the dream with
him and couples began to dance on the stage where Hermes
de Bianca had danced. Yet as they danced, close to one another,
there was a certain fear within each of them, an uncertainty
and a dread.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‚ÄúWhat do you think of that?‚Äù asked Lewis.</p>

<p>He was breathing quickly, Carla noticed. His face was
flushed and he was excited, more excited than she had
thought he could possibly be.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt is very ... erotic,‚Äù she said, knowing how inadequate
that word was.</p>

<p>Holton was sweating when she turned to ask him what he
thought. He looked angry.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDid you like it, Bob?‚Äù she asked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt,‚Äù he said. He took out his handkerchief and
dried his face. ‚ÄúChrist, but it‚Äôs hot in here. Why don‚Äôt we
go?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIn a moment,‚Äù said Lewis, now recovered. ‚ÄúYou must
meet dear Hermes. I‚Äôll go back stage and get him.‚Äù He stood
up, looked around the room to see if he were being watched;
then, satisfied that he was, he went back stage.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt care for this?‚Äù Carla asked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI guess I don‚Äôt. I never saw anything like this before. I
used to hear a lot of stories but I didn‚Äôt think there were
really such places.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThere are many a lot worse, said Carla. Of course I‚Äôm
used to it. You see my husband is....‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>He smiled. ‚ÄúI guess you were right about not coming
here.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt regret it?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think it was a very good idea for you to see something
of this world. Perhaps you can understand me better now,
knowing that I‚Äôm living with people like these, married to
a person like Lewis.‚Äù</p>

<p>He frowned and looked very serious and she was happy
to see him concerned. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you leave him, can‚Äôt you leave
Bankton?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhere would I go? He‚Äôs a charming person and I like
him. I‚Äôd have to find someone else before I could leave.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said, not understanding her, ‚ÄúI see what you
mean.‚Äù</p>

<p>George <em>Robert</em> Lewis returned leading Hermes, still in
costume, by the hand.</p>

<p>Everyone was polite. Hermes lisped that he was glad to
meet them and he shook hands squashily with both Holton
and Carla. Then they sat down at the table.</p>

<p>Lewis was excited. ‚ÄúYou know Hermes has made the most
dreadfully big decision? He‚Äôs going to Rome!‚Äù Trumpets did
not blow at that moment in the band; they should have,
though.</p>

<p>Carla was puzzled. ‚ÄúYou mean he‚Äôs going to Italy?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, darling, he‚Äôs becoming a Roman Catholic. Isn‚Äôt it
the most thrilling thing!‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI suppose so,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI used to be a Catholic myself.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù asked Hermes in a lisping little girl‚Äôs
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúI seemed to‚Äôve gotten out of the idea. I married a Protestant,
of course.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat a pity,‚Äù murmured Hermes, looking at Holton admiringly;
‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs the only answer, really the only answer.
Almost everyone I know is going over to Rome so
there must be <em>something</em> in it.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúPerhaps there is,‚Äù said Carla. ‚ÄúI think in Italy we take
the Church too much for granted.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI do wish,‚Äù said Lewis, ‚Äúthat I could get interested in it.
There seems to be such a rush for rosaries today. But I‚Äôm
dreadfully afraid I‚Äôm just a hedonistic pagan.‚Äù He put his
hand on Hermes‚Äô plump little hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always felt that
somewhere there is a faith that I could grasp onto.‚Äù With
his other hand he took a drink out of his recently filled glass.
‚ÄúSometimes one feels so lost, so homeless. I think there must
always be a womb-longing in each of us, a desire to go back
where we came from. I used to think that art was enough
but I suppose I was wrong because I never had much real
satisfaction from it. Carla here will say it is love that gives
us a reason, but I don‚Äôt think so. I‚Äôve always been in love.
Occasionally with my own image, I must admit, but there
<em>have</em> been others. No, I never got much out of love. Hermes
here has his dancing, but I don‚Äôt think that was enough for
him either....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúPerhaps you‚Äôve never given enough of yourself to another
person,‚Äù said Carla.</p>

<p>‚ÄúVampire,‚Äù chuckled Lewis. ‚ÄúOur identities are the only
real things we have in this shadowy world.‚Äù He was in good
form now and he was becoming drugged with his own facility.
‚ÄúNo, we must try to obtain a faith, or at least a medium,
to carry out our search for immortality, or should I say perpetuation?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
Women, normal women, seem to have less fear
of death because they have the function of child-bearing.
They are able to experience their own perpetuation; and in
their primitive way they feel a part of all mankind and there
are no real mysteries for them, no need of logic. But man is
different. The act of procreation is a pleasure and not painful
and, therefore, he does not observe that in that function
his own image is mirrored through eternity. He turns then
to art (the sensitive talented man, I mean now) and in making
pictures or books, playing at creation, he hopes to survive
death but he is never really convinced: at best he is
hypnotized, he is drugged by his art and in desperation he
tries to make meaning out of his own creations: playthings,
in reality. And so he finds himself in the end with chisel
and mallet in his hands making a statue and no nearer perpetuation,
closer only to death.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow beautiful!‚Äù exclaimed Hermes. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs why we
all have to go to Rome.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúPerhaps that‚Äôs the answer.‚Äù He began to speak again, his
flat voice rising and falling without emotion in it. Carla
looked at Holton questioningly. He nodded.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBob and I have to go now,‚Äù she said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, you must stay a little longer,‚Äù he pleaded.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe really have to go,‚Äù said Holton, rising. They thanked
him (Lewis insisted on paying the bill) and said good-bye.
George <em>Robert</em> Lewis was still talking to Hermes as they
left.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><em>Chapter Eleven</em></h2>
</div>


<p class="p2">‚ÄúHow cool it is!‚Äù said Carla, as they walked along the
street. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt breathe in there.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt was a crazy place,‚Äù said Holton, looking straight ahead
as he walked, following the traffic lights. Carla occasionally
drew him off the curb and into the street but he always
managed to obey the green lights.</p>

<p>They decided to walk uptown, to walk to Times Square.</p>

<p>Carla felt light and happy now that Lewis had been left
behind.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI like the air in New York,‚Äù she said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe air?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs exciting and silly and everyone is busy doing things
they don‚Äôt want to do but still it‚Äôs stimulating.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI suppose so.‚Äù</p>

<p>She hadn‚Äôt decided yet whether he tried to be noncommittal
or whether he had nothing to say. No, he had something
to say: she was sure of that. He was shy and he felt
things very much but he was afraid to say them. She remembered
now that he had told her things about himself in
Florence. He had told her about his parents and his life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
though he hadn‚Äôt told her what he wanted to do. He still
would not tell her that and, if he knew, she would have to
discover it.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow long are you going to be in town?‚Äù he asked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. A month perhaps, I don‚Äôt know. I think
Bankton will be coming over soon. They‚Äôre going to give him
a big show here.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to see him.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôd like to meet you, too.‚Äù She laughed. ‚ÄúI might lose
you to him‚Äù She stopped herself quickly. She shouldn‚Äôt have
said ‚Äúlose‚Äù because they were supposed to be just casual
friends; at least, that was the basis he seemed to want. She
mustn‚Äôt frighten him. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd like him,‚Äù she said
easily, in control now. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs rather jealous and disagreeable.‚Äù</p>

<p>They crossed more streets, dodged more cars, bumped
into more and more people and, finally, they came to Times
Square.</p>

<p>At Forty-second Street they stopped and Carla looked at
the lights for a long time.</p>

<p>It seemed as if all the commercialism in the world had
decided to concentrate itself in one place, as if by blazing
colored lights and moving signs it could justify itself.</p>

<p>At one end of the square a giant sign exploded colors, advertising
cigarettes. Another cigarette advertisement had a
man puffing smoke; it was most realistic because real smoke
or something like smoke came out of his mouth. Soft drinks
and chewing gum and cigarettes&mdash;all the small things&mdash;were
displayed in the most magnificent manner. There was an almost
religious appeal in the brightness of the lights, the
cathedral-like splendor of the signs which supported countless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
colored bulbs of light: everything was so large, so magnificent,
so desperately appealing.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSuch wonderful strength,‚Äù murmured Carla, ‚Äúso much
misguided energy.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very nice to look at,‚Äù said Robert Holton, speaking
self-consciously for America.</p>

<p>They stood pressed against a building while hundreds of
people pushed by them in a thick stream. Carla studied the
lights, mesmerized by their colors: red passionate ones and
guttering greens, blue and yellow glowing, and moving figures;
they even had the lights turn on and off in such a fashion
that silhouetted men appeared to dance and animated
animals had adventures. The lights were most splendid and
nowhere in the world was so much grandeur hung against
the sky. Carla watched the lights.</p>

<p>Yellow taxicabs clattered by them and everyone moved
quickly. Everyone had at least a destination and that was a
hopeful sign. She didn‚Äôt care to think what their destinations
might be.</p>

<p>She looked at the buildings and saw that they were not
tall. They looked like buildings in Paris or London. Squat
and dirty and rather Victorian: the buildings were most ordinary
but there was so much light over them, against them,
all around them that they became as insubstantial as theater
props.</p>

<p>The movie houses which filled the lower parts of most of
the buildings of the square had the most light. Their marquees
rippled and glittered with names. Large posters were
hung wherever there was no electricity. People moved in
constant streams into the movies, while other people, as constantly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
came out, blinking their eyes, adjusting themselves
to reality.</p>

<p>Then there was the noise. Not a really individual noise,
not like an Italian crowd, hoarse and insistent, but a roar
with sharp breaks and a rhythm like an automobile engine,
a noise like a discordant piece of music with the rumblings
of a subway train as a bass. The conversations of many
people made a sound as soothing and as natural as the sea
but the mechanical things made sharp overtones, set the
rhythm of Times Square and of many lives.</p>

<p>Slowly Carla and Robert Holton allowed themselves to
become a part of the current of people, gliding with them
toward the north end of the square.</p>

<p>First of all were the young adventurers: boys with dark
skins and dark clever eyes, dressed in the spirit of the jazz
they had made their own without understanding. Looking
for sex, they walked together in groups, talking in whining
voices, unpleasant nasal voices.</p>

<p>Young girls with bleached blond hair that looked untidy
and unclean walked in twos together, looking for men. Their
well-formed bodies with tight breasts moved self-consciously
as they walked on awkward high heels. They laughed too
loudly, giggled too much and stared at sailors.</p>

<p>The couples were the happiest-looking of all. They always
walked with wonder in their faces, conscious of each other
as they walked through all the light and sound.</p>

<p>Old men in dirty clothes moved slowly, looking for cigarette
butts. This was not new to them; they had known the
square before and found it good hunting though not as congenial
as quiet places. They had stopped looking for sex:
only cigarette butts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>Cripples and bums sang songs and rattled tin cups. It was
hard to tell what they were looking for besides charity. Perhaps
they had stopped their long search. Carla was sorry
for them.</p>

<p>Hot stale air rushed out of the theater lobbies and from
the bars and restaurants; stale air rushed upward from the
subway ventilators in the sidewalk. The cool night was defeated
by the city, even the darkness had been defeated for
it was as light as day, as light as day and much prettier and
more exciting.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat a place!‚Äù said Carla. ‚ÄúSo <em>much</em> is here. Is this the
dream Lewis was talking about?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think,‚Äù said Carla, laughing, ‚Äúthis is the peak of your
civilization.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúProbably; it‚Äôs the sign of the century.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut there will be other centuries.‚Äù And they thought of
other centuries when they would not be alive and they tried
to see the square in future years&mdash;if the square survived with
the dream.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Outside the Bijou Theater Marjorie Ventusa stood, trying
to make up her mind if she wanted to see her favorite actress
suffer. Marjorie liked pictures that made her cry. She wasn‚Äôt
sure, however, if she wanted to cry tonight.</p>

<p>Mrs Merrin had been quite pleasant that evening when
Marjorie left and this made her feel good. She stood now,
undecided, Times Square all around her. She often faced
the high prices of the square to see new movies. She liked
crowded places because she felt happy with a lot of people
around her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>She stood beside the box office, warmed by the air from
the theater. The sight of all the people and lights made her
feel secure as though she were not really alone, for she identified
herself with every couple that passed by. She had no
envy.</p>

<p>Marjorie was about to go into the movie when she saw
Robert Holton crossing a street on the other side of the
square. She had a sudden impulse to call him, to make herself
heard over the hundreds of people. Then she saw that
he was not alone. She saw that he was with a dark pretty
girl: a woman from the world where he lived. Marjorie Ventusa
watched him as he walked with this person across the
street. Then, on the other side, she lost him. He had disappeared
with the dark woman.</p>

<p>The square had changed now and the lights were cruel.
The noises became oppressive and she felt shut out of the
lives of the people who passed her.</p>

<p>Marjorie Ventusa grabbed her black patent-leather handbag
close to her and, controlling herself, she walked along
the square. She walked slowly, allowing others to push by
her. She passed in front of many movie houses and many
bars. There was a great noise all around her, harsh voices
and much laughing. She hated the laughing the most. Two
young girls were stopped by two sailors in front of her and
they spoke together in the light of a red neon sign. The
sailors said something and the girls laughed. Quickly Marjorie
Ventusa walked by them.</p>

<p>A group of boys were standing in a blue light and they
were laughing in their harsh changing voices. She wished
they would stop. Looking downward, she walked through
the crowd, no longer with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>Marjorie Ventusa was the center now of laughing people
and her eyes were dazzled by changing lights.</p>

<p>Finally, out of breath, and at the northern end of the
square, she stopped and pressed against a building. She
looked back at the places she had just left and she was tired.</p>

<p>A stout little man was staring at her. He was trying to
figure out what she was and what he might dare do. She
looked at him with disgust, but he was not bothered by this
and, thinking her a whore, he separated himself from the
crowd and came over to where she stood. He leaned against
the building a few feet from her. Slowly, calmly he took a
package of cigarettes out of his pocket. He turned to her
now, offering her a cigarette.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWant a smoke?‚Äù</p>

<p>She shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, thanks.‚Äù</p>

<p>He took one himself and lighted it. He inhaled to show
how calm he was and then he said, ‚ÄúYou want to walk
maybe?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said furiously, comparing him with Robert Holton.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to walk with you.‚Äù She turned away from
him and went quickly toward the nearest movie. Without
once looking back she bought a ticket. As she gave the
ticket to the man at the door she heard the stout man
whistle as he walked past the theater.</p>

<p>Setting her face, she walked into the marble and gold
lobby. She walked, conscious of a thousand nonexistent eyes
watching her back.</p>

<p>Then she entered the darkened hall of the movie. On the
screen two characters, simulating love, were laughing loudly.
Marjorie Ventusa was trapped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>Caroline and Jim Trebling had been giggling all evening.
Caroline had never known anyone quite so amusing as Trebling.
He had no respect for anything; at least, no respect for
the things most people did. He made fun of her office and
her job and he was pleasant as he did it; not bitter as so
many people were.</p>

<p>He had suggested that they visit Times Square and go
dancing in one of the large dance halls there. She had tried
to talk him into going some place more expensive but he
had said that he didn‚Äôt have the money and that as long as
you danced somewhere that was all that counted.</p>

<p>From Fifth Avenue they walked along Forty-Seventh
Street until, finally, they came to the square. Trebling
blinked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the damnedest sight! I don‚Äôt think it can compare
with L.A. but there really is something wonderful about it.‚Äù</p>

<p>Caroline regarded the square without much emotion. She
had seen it all her life. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs too crowded,‚Äù she said
finally, wishing that he had decided to take her to a better
place, a place with a big name, one she could talk about
later.</p>

<p>He stood, however, staring at the lights; then he lowered
his eyes from the lights and looked at the people.
She noticed now that he looked at people a great deal. Even
when they were talking he always stared at people as though
there was something wrong with them.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy‚Äôre you looking around all the time?‚Äù asked Caroline.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand you at all. I don‚Äôt think they like being
stared at.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù He hadn‚Äôt been listening to her. ‚ÄúWhy do I ...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
stare? I just like to look at them and see what they‚Äôre so
busy rushing around for.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you know?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, do you?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell....‚Äù She hesitated, uncertain of her meaning, uncertain
of what they were talking about.</p>

<p>He laughed. She admired his way of telling when she
couldn‚Äôt understand him; he never really embarrassed her
by trying to talk over her head as some men tried to do: not
that they really could, of course. She was an American
woman and just as smart as any man. Caroline stood there
looking at the square with Trebling who had just laughed
and saved her from embarrassment; Caroline stood erect and
sure of herself and her emancipation, her arm in his.</p>

<p>Then, without speaking, he led her across the middle of
the square. It was dazzling to cross between the many lights.
Caroline liked the colors. They seemed rather cozy to her.
Times Square was in many ways her symbol of home. It was
no longer interesting because home is never interesting but
she liked it still.</p>

<p>‚ÄúLook at all the movie houses,‚Äù he said when they had
gotten over on the other side. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much of everything.
But it‚Äôs dirty. It‚Äôs all awfully dirty.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIs it?‚Äù Caroline had not thought of that. Perhaps the
square was not very clean but how could it be? There were
always so many people coming to be impressed or depressed
by it.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBob used to talk a lot about this part of town, about
Broadway. I think he used to like it a lot,‚Äù said Trebling.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIs that right?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh, sure. He was a playboy during the war.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>Caroline was surprised but not very interested. ‚ÄúHe sure‚Äôs
changed a lot,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a nice fellow and I know you
think a lot of him but he‚Äôs a little dull ... now, anyway.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think,‚Äù said Trebling, ‚Äúthat people sometimes feel they
have to change to protect themselves. He‚Äôs just making a
new life now.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs certainly making a dull one.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNot if it‚Äôs what he wants.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúImagine working in an office if you could do something
else!‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat about yourself?‚Äù</p>

<p>Caroline flushed; she had found herself becoming so much
involved with Trebling‚Äôs personality that she had begun to
lose her own in his: she had begun to think that she was as
free as he was or, rather, as he felt he was. She had to retrace
now; she must go back into herself. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do anything
else,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all I know&mdash;working in an
office.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou could get married.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI suppose I could.‚Äù Purposely she left it at that. He didn‚Äôt
ask her anything else. They watched the square.</p>

<p>Caroline was conscious of odors, too conscious of them.
There were a great many unpleasant odors in the square:
beer and cigarette smoke and exhaust; perfume and sweat
and stale air from theaters and subways; food cooking&mdash;hot
dogs, hamburgers, popcorn and peanuts. She got a little
dizzy just breathing.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCome on, Jim,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go find the dance hall.‚Äù</p>

<p>They walked together along the crowded streets and as
they walked he told her wonderful stories of freedom that
were not true but still very interesting; and she thought him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
the most fascinating man she knew and not at all like his
dull friend Robert Holton.</p>

<p>At last they came to a dance hall. As much as she liked
the glitter of the square it was a relief to go inside the red-upholstered,
mirror-walled dance hall where the only odors
were of perfume and cigarette smoke.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been here for so long,‚Äù she said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr Heywood came out of the theater. He had left in the
middle of the last act. It was his personal strategy to do this
because it meant that he missed the crowd and the long
wait for his car to find him.</p>

<p>The play had been dreary and he had seen it only because
a friend of his knew the girl in it. Besides, Mr Heywood did
not like to go to plays alone. His wife no longer went with
him and he was afraid of taking other women around with
him because people talked. He did not like any men at all.</p>

<p>The street was almost deserted. The theaters still were
full and their chaste white light signs shone cleanly into the
street. Two blocks away was Times Square. He could just
barely make out the colored sign of a soft drink bottle. He
shuddered as he thought of soft drinks.</p>

<p>He stood in front of the theater, the light from the marquee
shining dramatically down upon him. He would stand
here now without moving until his waiting chauffeur saw
him and took him away. To his left he heard the sound of a
motor starting. He did not look to his left. He merely stood
now, self-contained and passive, waiting.</p>

<p>His car stopped in front of him. The chauffeur got out,
opened the door and said something to him and Mr Heywood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
said something to the chauffeur and an understanding
was reached. Mr Heywood got into the car and the chauffeur
drove down the street into the square and toward home.</p>

<p>Mr Heywood shrank from the lights that suddenly made
the inside of his car as colorful as a rainbow. He tried not
to look out the window at the square but it was impossible
not to look. His eyes were drawn by the force of the lights
and he looked out finally.</p>

<p>All the cheapness he hated was in the square. The people
of whom he was terrified moved all about him now. The
noises he hated to hear and the lights he hated to see intruded.
He shuddered and wondered if he was going to be
sick.</p>

<p>Finally they left the square.</p>

<p>He felt much better now that they were in the quieter
darker places of the city. Mr Heywood was lonely now. He
had always been lonely and that was his personal sadness.
He wished that he were young. It was impossible to be
lonely when one was young. He wished that he were Robert
Holton.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Carla and Holton stopped to rest at the northern end of
the square. They stood upon a small island of concrete surrounded
by avenues. A red light shone across Holton‚Äôs face
giving him a sinister expression. Carla laughed.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so funny?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYour face ... you look like Mephisto.‚Äù He smiled and
stepped out of the red light and stood beside her.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat do you think of it now?‚Äù asked Holton as they
stood on their island, watching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúThe things I‚Äôve always thought. It‚Äôs very brilliant. It is
a ... production.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúEveryone comes to see it.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd I think it means something different to each one.
It‚Äôs like a work of art that way.‚Äù She paused and added, ‚ÄúIt
is a work of art.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAn unfriendly one, though.‚Äù</p>

<p>She shrugged. ‚ÄúArt doesn‚Äôt have to be friendly. To me all
this bad taste is very alive and miraculous.‚Äù She was going
to say more but she was not sure of her English. The language
she had learned had been literary and she was occasionally
conscious of not speaking ordinary words. Holton
had not been listening, though. Caught in the magic she had
performed upon the square, he was melting into it, his eyes
fixed on the effect and not the details.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat a place to make a decision,‚Äù he said firmly, turning
to look at her.</p>

<p>‚ÄúA decision?‚Äù She was not sure of him now; not sure of
the magic. ‚ÄúWhat sort of decision?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you later.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIf you like.‚Äù She could see that he was not ready to talk
to her yet. The signs were good, though. He was returning.</p>

<p>Arm in arm they deserted their concrete island. They
crossed the street and stood for a moment on the edge of
the square, looking back at the lights.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhere do you want to go?‚Äù asked Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBack to my hotel,‚Äù she said, not looking at him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúShall I go with you?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúDo you want to?‚Äù She noticed that one of the largest
signs had several dead lights in it.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOf course I want to,‚Äù he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>She was very happy then. The bridge was completed.</p>

<p>‚ÄúShall we walk? It‚Äôs not far.‚Äù He nodded. They left the
bright square and walked northward, not speaking. The
bridge was not yet strong.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><em>Chapter Twelve</em></h2>
</div>


<p class="p2">They stood a moment in the gray heavily carpeted corridor.
The hotel was an expensive one and this was the first
time Robert Holton had been inside it.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm down here,‚Äù said Carla, taking a key out of her bag.
She led him down the corridor.</p>

<p>She stopped, unlocked a door, and they went inside.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIn America you always try to make everything look expensive,‚Äù
she said. ‚ÄúBut I like this room.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúLooks like Hollywood,‚Äù said Holton. Carla looked about
her and agreed. The walls were dull green and the ceiling
white. The furniture was low and modern and there was
much glass in the room: mirrors and glass-topped tables.
Two large windows looked out on Central Park. At the left
was the doorway to the bedroom.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBankton must have a lot of money,‚Äù murmured Holton.</p>

<p>Carla smiled. ‚ÄúNo, I have, but that‚Äôs not important. Sit
down over there, Bob.‚Äù She motioned to a white couch by
the window. ‚ÄúWould you like something to drink?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIf you want one.‚Äù</p>

<p>While she fixed his drink she would be able to think of
the right thing to say. She felt constrained still and her heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
was beating rapidly. She prepared the drink deliberately
and, satisfied that it was right, she turned and walked over
to him. ‚ÄúHere you are.‚Äù Then she sat down beside him.</p>

<p>They looked out at the city. Carla sat straight on the edge
of the couch, her eyes fixed on the tall buildings. She was
conscious of Holton‚Äôs slow breathing beside her. The silence
was becoming difficult; then he picked up his glass and ice
clattered and the silence broke.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTell me,‚Äù she said, sitting back in the couch, ‚Äúwhat do
you do during the days? What does a broker do?‚Äù</p>

<p>He opened his coat and relaxed. ‚ÄúNot much, I‚Äôm afraid.
I get all sorts of statistical books and I make out reports
from them. It‚Äôs pretty dull.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow long are you going to have to do that?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know ... a year maybe. I think Mr Heywood&mdash;he
was the fellow we met at the party&mdash;I think he‚Äôs going
to move me out in the selling end.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou would like that?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt means more money and it‚Äôs going to be my career.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right; it‚Äôs going to be your career.‚Äù</p>

<p>Holton crossed his legs, using the movement to give himself
time to think. Carla waited, watching him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAre you going to live in Florence?‚Äù he asked finally.</p>

<p>This was not going at all well, she thought. ‚ÄúI think I may
live there part of the year. I think I shall travel first.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhere? Where do you want to go?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSome place in the Near East, some place like the <em>Arabian
Nights</em>&mdash;you‚Äôve read it, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI read it once.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI always wanted things to be like that, to be enchanted.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôve been disappointed?‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>She nodded. ‚ÄúSometimes I‚Äôve been very disappointed but,
you see, sooner or later it‚Äôs all right. I‚Äôve great faith in things
being right.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a curious girl,‚Äù he said. He looked at her and she
could see her own face twice reflected in his eyes. ‚ÄúYou
don‚Äôt,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúreally like Bankton, do you?‚Äù</p>

<p>The words were making the proper patterns now. She
turned so that he would see all her face when she spoke.
‚ÄúYes, I like him very much but I don‚Äôt love him. I can‚Äôt love
anyone without having it complete, without having ... the
other thing.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat we had.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, what we had.‚Äù She felt that now he was coming
back again.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt was so long ago, wasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù She wasn‚Äôt sure now that
he was coming back: ‚Äúso long ago.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve remembered it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt seem long ago
to me.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI meant that ... well ...
so much has happened to us since then. You‚Äôve been married
and I left the army....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not much different, are we?‚Äù She looked out the
window now and watched different lights go out in the tall
buildings; for each light that went out, though, someone else
turned on another. ‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù she said, concentrating on
the lights, ‚Äúyou know you were really the first for me.‚Äù</p>

<p>He was awkward now. ‚ÄúYes, I guess I was. I didn‚Äôt....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThere were probably a lot of others for you in Europe.
You know, I haven‚Äôt really wanted any man since then.‚Äù</p>

<p>This had to surprise; she wanted this to be her strongest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
weapon. She looked at him now. He had put down his drink
and he was looking at her.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIs that true?‚Äù</p>

<p>She nodded. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I shouldn‚Äôt tell you. I
couldn‚Äôt keep from telling you.‚Äù She tried not to look at him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou mean what happened to us in Italy was the only
time...?‚Äù He was confused.</p>

<p>She turned then and looked at him, at the troubled eyes
and the boy‚Äôs mouth. ‚ÄúMy dear, when something means a
lot to you I think it‚Äôs hard to take a substitute. You see, I
made an object for myself. I was upset when you left, naturally,
because you‚Äôd become my object. I never heard from
you and so I married Bankton in London. I never lost my
object, though. It never changed.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he said.</p>

<p>Carla smiled. ‚ÄúI understand it now. You had so many
women and I was only one. I think that‚Äôs all right, I think
that‚Äôs natural. I hoped you might have felt the way I did.
One always wants to be loved and it‚Äôs not easy to find a
lover. I never had another man&mdash;not because I couldn‚Äôt, but
because I didn‚Äôt want to. I was waiting all that time, hoping
to see <em>you</em> again.‚Äù She had said everything now. He had
listened and there was nothing else she could do.</p>

<p>He ran his hand through his hair. ‚ÄúI was very close to
you,‚Äù he said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI thought you were.‚Äù She was waiting.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, there were a lot of others, but I don‚Äôt think
I loved any of them.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo one at all?‚Äù</p>

<p>He didn‚Äôt answer. He stood up and walked across the
room. Then he came back and stood looking down at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say. We were very close once and
then I came back here and made myself forget everything
about Europe, everything that had happened to me there.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt hasn‚Äôt been easy to do. The only way I could get by,
though, was to do what I‚Äôm doing: become a broker. I can‚Äôt
be the way I was; I can‚Äôt afford it. Of course I can still have
all the girls I want and I can have a good time. I suppose
I can fall in love sometime ... again, but I have to be a
conventional person and I don‚Äôt mind.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTonight those people were examples of freedom....‚Äù</p>

<p>She interrupted him. ‚ÄúNot really freedom, self-indulgence
perhaps.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhatever it is, they call it being free. I don‚Äôt want that.
I couldn‚Äôt have that kind anyway because I‚Äôm not talented;
I don‚Äôt do anything well and I know it.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou can be a free person, though.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow?‚Äù</p>

<p>She sighed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already told you and you already know.
You can love.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou think that‚Äôs the answer?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know any other. It‚Äôs been important to me.‚Äù</p>

<p>He sat down beside her, sat close to her. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if
I could love someone,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I could love
you the way you‚Äôd want.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou can,‚Äù said Carla. ‚ÄúYou can do whatever you want.‚Äù</p>

<p>His hand touched hers. She sat very straight then, her
eyes on the window, on the white lights. He put his arm
around her shoulders and kissed her and she closed her eyes
upon the lights outside.</p>

<p>For a long time they were like that on the couch. Then
they separated and stood up, self-conscious and shy, newly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
discovered. He motioned with his hand toward the bedroom.
She nodded and they went into the bedroom together
and met finally in the middle of the bridge.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Robert Holton held Carla from him at arm‚Äôs length and
looked at her. She was pretty, at this moment quite beautiful,
her face white and her greenish eyes glittering.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting, Bob,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve waited such a
long time.‚Äù He pulled her to him then, her body against his.
A part of him was given up entirely to making love but another
part was still detached, still watching.</p>

<p>He helped her to undo her dress. Modestly now, with the
reserve of strangers, they stood back to back as they undressed.</p>

<p>She was beautiful and he had forgotten that. She was not
really pale: her skin was gold. She was slim and cleanly
made and her breasts were small. They faced each other and
looked at each other, the detached, the lonely part of himself
memorizing every detail of her.</p>

<p>Carla walked slowly toward him and touched his shoulder.
Tears were in her eyes.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù he asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head and smiled: nothing was the matter
now.</p>

<p>He took her slowly then, pressing her against his body
gently, every nerve vibrating in both of them; hearts beating
quickly.</p>

<p>They stood like this in the middle of the room; then she
broke away and walked over to the bed and pulled the cover
down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúTurn out the light, Bob,‚Äù she whispered. It was a ceremony
now: neither of them spoke out loud in the presence
of the miracle taking place. He turned out the light. The
room was dark except for the lighted dots of windows in the
buildings opposite and, over the buildings, like unorganized
window lights, cold stars shone clearly.</p>

<p>He turned and walked to the bed. Carla lay on her back,
her arms behind her head. He got in beside her and they lay
there together, not speaking, hardly breathing, and he felt
the blood pounding in his head while, next to him, Carla
was shivering, was waiting. He turned over on his side,
barely touching her.</p>

<p>They did not speak now. Words were discarded and no
surface was needed. Instinct guided them finally, made them
a separate world together; there was only a dream existence
outside of themselves.</p>

<p>And Robert Holton became the lover and ceased to be
himself; his detached awareness was, for the time, submerged
and forgotten.</p>

<p>He ran his hands over her, feeling the smooth skin of her
shoulders, her thighs.... They kissed and began the act of
completion.</p>

<p>To Holton it became a battle and a surrender, a taking
and a giving; it became a fusion. He was no longer himself,
he was enlarged; a giant in a world of giant sensations. He
was no longer alone or incomplete.</p>

<p>Then the rhythm was found and the wild twistings and
strugglings stopped. He was conquering now and, in the
conquering, giving.</p>

<p>He entered her and to the rhythm of their fast-beating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
hearts, with a rush of sound like wind in his ears, he discovered
the single world. Lights whirled inside his head, behind
his eyes: they came in series&mdash;circles of sharp lights.</p>

<p>He was choking then, barely breathing, able only to
cough and gasp. Sweat covered him; his hands clutched at
her shoulders as though they were the only remaining solidity
in a world rapidly disintegrating into sensations and fast-moving
lights and a quick wind.</p>

<p>There was no time now. There was no memory. There was
no reason. The struggle stopped and the moment came like
fire.</p>

<p>Carla‚Äôs face was buried in his shoulder; she stiffened and
then became relaxed, the battle finished and won.</p>

<p>Like fire it came and the wonder was achieved; a world
was glimpsed and lost in a moment. Then, tide-like, the
emotion stopped and withdrew. The ecstasy was gone and
only two people were left in its wake, left on a high shore,
exhausted, shipwrecked.</p>

<p>Robert Holton lay for a moment upon Carla‚Äôs still body,
supporting himself with his elbows so that he would not
crush her; he breathed deeply, taking in the air with great
sobs. Beneath him Carla was quiet, at peace, her shuddering
stopped.</p>

<p>He kissed her very gently then and they separated, without
words; they lay quietly side by side, touching each other,
yet apart, the trace of their fire still inside of them, and exhaustion
brought with it no sadness, no loneliness.</p>

<p>Robert Holton put his arm under her head; then he looked
out the window, looked at the real stars, not nearly as bright
as the ones in his head, the ones they had made together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>Silence and darkness protected them.</p>

<p>Part of his mind became detached again and he saw himself
in relation to the world. He saw himself in a darkened
room of a large hotel, lying exhausted beside the wife of a
painter. He frowned in the dark and he fought the vision
of the outer world.</p>

<p>Carla moved her hand over his chest, twisting the hairs;
he felt a spasm of tenderness shake him and he took her and
held her close to him. This was the moment when he felt he
was not alone, felt that he was not a single particle lost in a
void. The half of him lost in the womb had been regained
and he was finally complete: he was God and earth and
other stars, so great was this fusion.</p>

<p>They slept quietly in each others arms. They slept unaware
of time for they <em>were</em> time.</p>

<p>Carla woke first. She gave a start and Robert Holton
opened his eyes, wondered where he was; then he saw Carla
beside him, saw a vague figure by the light of stars.</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>Caro mio</em>,‚Äù she murmured, saying the first words either
had spoken.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDarling,‚Äù he whispered.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so perfect,‚Äù she said and he put her head on his
shoulder again. Then they were still, looking at the uncertain
outline of their bodies on the whiteness of the bed.</p>

<p>He felt her smooth legs. They were cool, like dreams
half-remembered.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù she whispered into his ear, ‚Äúso much more
than you know.‚Äù</p>

<p>He kissed her for answer and his detached self almost
fused with hers, almost made a union, almost died and made
him free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>Carla turned on the light. It was two o‚Äôclock and they had
been asleep for almost an hour.</p>

<p>Robert Holton lay quietly on the bed, his eyes closed, his
breathing regular, one arm over his forehead as though to
defend himself. She leaned over and kissed him lightly, then
she got out of bed and went into the bathroom.</p>

<p>Her face shocked and pleased her. ‚ÄúHow depraved I look,‚Äù
she murmured to herself. Her face was glowing and her
eyes shone and glittered. There were red marks on her white
skin. His beard had scratched her and made her usually
white face pink. With a sudden gesture she swept her hair
back out of her face, held her dark curling hair captive.</p>

<p>Holton appeared behind her then and he put his arms
around her waist and kissed the back of her neck. She shuddered
and closed her eyes. She could not look at light with
so much inward light behind her eyes. They stood like that.
Then he let her go. They looked at each other: two people
now, so recently a single world.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHappy?‚Äù she asked.</p>

<p>He nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had it like this before,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúIt never meant as much to me as this.‚Äù</p>

<p>They walked back into the bedroom and sat down side by
side on the bed. Modestly Holton drew the sheet over their
laps. They sat quietly without speaking, their bare arms
around each other. When Carla looked at the window she
could no longer see stars and lighted windows; she could
see only their reflection on black glass.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat are you thinking?‚Äù he asked and she saw that he‚Äôd
been watching her.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNothing, Bob. I don‚Äôt think all the time, you know. I was
only feeling.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúFeeling what?‚Äù</p>

<p>She smiled. ‚ÄúFeeling all the world.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think I felt that, too ... to live in a big way....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, I know.‚Äù She sighed. ‚ÄúYou have to break all your
little patterns. You have to expand now.‚Äù</p>

<p>But there was resistance to this. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see why you can‚Äôt
have everything and still have that, too.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, everything must be the richest and the fullest. Have
you that?‚Äù</p>

<p>He stretched, the muscles moving under white skin.
‚ÄúMaybe it is; I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù He took her then and they fell
back together onto the bed. For several minutes they were
together and then he rolled over on his side. She opened
her eyes.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter, Bob?‚Äù she asked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said. He was looking at her, his dark
hair in his eyes. He pushed it back.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not sad?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo.‚Äù He ran his hands over her hips. ‚ÄúI was only wondering
what‚Äôs to happen next. You‚Äôll go back to Europe.‚Äù</p>

<p>She had been waiting for this. She had been waiting for
him to ask this. Now she could say what she felt but the
words did not come easily. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to go back,‚Äù she
said. ‚ÄúI can stay here as long as I like.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThen your husband‚Äôll come over here.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI can leave him.‚Äù</p>

<p>He shook his head. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt marry you.‚Äù</p>

<p>She was lost. She was falling now. It seemed as if the
room had become cold and foreign and she had come to a
hostile country. There was no longer an answer to make:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
the answer had been made. She tried not to let her face
show what she felt.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy couldn‚Äôt you marry me?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt any money.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI have.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt want that. You wouldn‚Äôt want to be married
to a broker and live in New York.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy do you have to be a broker?‚Äù</p>

<p>He sighed then and she saw for the first time that he was
the one trapped, the one who would not escape. ‚ÄúWhat else
can I do?‚Äù he asked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou can break with all this.‚Äù She was fighting.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBut what could I do? I have to do something. I have to
be something.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy do you have to be something? Why do you have to
do things that you don‚Äôt want, that make you unhappy?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúEveryone has to. Besides, I‚Äôm not sure that I am unhappy.‚Äù
She was defeated at that moment. The dream she
had been fashioning disappeared and there were no traces
of it left, only a lingering sadness and an open wound.</p>

<p>He went on talking and she answered him but there was
nothing left for either of them to discuss.</p>

<p>Then after a while they both stopped talking. They sat
side by side looking out the window, or rather looking at
themselves reflected in the black mirror. Holton turned out
the light and Carla was able to see the stars again.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat was funny, wasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù chuckled Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat? What was funny?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúLewis tonight and all those people talking about religion
and art.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it was funny; I think it was sad.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy sad?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThey were lost, I think. Just like us, Bob.‚Äù</p>

<p>She could feel him looking at her. ‚ÄúAre you?‚Äù he asked
softly.</p>

<p>She would not let herself cry. She would not give way.
She would have to be strong now. Her voice carefully controlled,
she said, ‚ÄúNo more than you. We could be complete,
I think.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think we could,‚Äù he said and she knew that he felt
nothing the way she did. Carla had the feeling of coming
into a stranger‚Äôs house expecting friends, expecting familiar
things. She was with an unknown, a man who did not feel
what she did.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI had hoped,‚Äù said Carla, ‚Äúthat we could.‚Äù She was going
to be accurate in what she said. She used each word like the
cut of a knife to sever the relationship, to kill her own love.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we can now. You want to live a certain life.
You want what you know and though you don‚Äôt like it you
think it‚Äôs the safe thing. I don‚Äôt understand you, I‚Äôm afraid.
I‚Äôve tried to see all this through your eyes. I didn‚Äôt want it
to be just another one, another woman. I wanted it to be
important to you: it was so important to me. I think I was
wrong. I think I was selfish and I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù She wondered
when her voice would break.</p>

<p>Then Holton tried to reconstruct at last. ‚ÄúNo, you don‚Äôt
understand. I feel very close to you. I‚Äôve liked this more
than any other time, more than with anyone else. But you
see I can‚Äôt leave what I‚Äôm doing; I couldn‚Äôt live on you for
the rest of my life.‚Äù</p>

<p>She sighed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs such a superficial thing; that‚Äôs all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
surface. When you feel something for another person those
things don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSomeday they might. Of course I‚Äôm lonely and not very
happy. You have to accept that. In a few years I‚Äôll get married
and maybe that‚Äôll make it better. I could,‚Äù he was
speaking slowly now, ‚Äúmarry you. I could do that but you
wouldn‚Äôt be happy.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow do you know I wouldn‚Äôt be happy here?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre different, that‚Äôs all. I can‚Äôt tell you what the difference
is. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù</p>

<p>And she couldn‚Äôt tell him what the difference was. There
was no way to tell.</p>

<p>He put his arms around her in the dark and they relaxed
on the bed and she tried to give herself to the moment but
she could not: too much had been given already.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a temptation,‚Äù said Holton suddenly.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat is?‚Äù They separated.</p>

<p>‚ÄúTo go to Europe with you, to live with you.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt could be done.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúMaybe.... No, it wouldn‚Äôt work.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt just wouldn‚Äôt be practical.‚Äù</p>

<p>No, she thought, it wouldn‚Äôt be practical.</p>

<p>Then the passion came back to them and she almost forgot
his withdrawal. She fell back onto the pillows, his body
over hers.</p>

<p>He whispered in her ear, ‚ÄúYou know I really have to leave
after this.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOf course you must,‚Äù said Carla, dying gently.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><em>Chapter Thirteen</em></h2>
</div>


<p class="p2">The early morning was cold and Robert Holton shivered
as he left the warm lobby of the hotel. He stood outside on
the sidewalk and wondered where he was. He turned to the
left and walked a few steps and then he remembered the
street he was on, remembered where east and west were. He
turned to the right and walked rapidly toward Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>The streets were almost deserted. Occasionally a taxicab
would clatter by. Occasionally a tired couple looking for a
room would pass him on the sidewalk. As he walked, his own
footsteps made sharp regular noises on the pavement.</p>

<p>He came at last to a subway entrance. He breathed
deeply, took a last breath of clean air and went down inside
the ground.</p>

<p>Pale lights burned in old sockets and a sleepy Negro sat
within the money-changer‚Äôs booth. A sailor stood vomiting
in a corner; he was very quiet about it and the Negro paid
no attention to him.</p>

<p>Robert Holton put his nickel in the turnstile.</p>

<p>On the platform several people were waiting for the train.
They were all tired. Another sailor had a girl and he was
standing very close to her. They were both drunk and made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
strange little movements with their heads and hands, slow-motion
movements, as though they were flying.</p>

<p>Robert Holton stood against an iron pillar. He felt exhausted
but physically serene. He rested his head on the
hard rough surface. It was pleasant to stand like this, underground.</p>

<p>The uptown train stopped with a jolt, the doors opened
and Robert Holton stepped into the lighted train. The doors
closed and the train started again.</p>

<p>Everyone in the car was weary or drunk or both. Papers
and cigarette butts covered the floor. A pair of dirty gloves
lay at his feet, forgotten by the owner, unwanted.</p>

<p>Robert Holton tried to sleep but the glare of light through
his eyelids was distracting. His physical exhaustion was
lessening, too, and he began to feel a return of energy.</p>

<p>He would not think of Carla, though; he would not think
of her for a little while. He would wait until he was in his
room.</p>

<p>After a long time, after ten minutes, the train stopped at
his station and he climbed out of the ground and stood on
the concrete surface of the earth; a suggestion of morning
was in the sky and the wind blew fresh and cold from the
river. He walked to his hotel.</p>

<p>‚ÄúEvening,‚Äù said the clerk behind the desk.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood evening,‚Äù said Holton.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIs it getting colder out?‚Äù</p>

<p>Holton nodded. ‚ÄúProbably be a real cold day tomorrow.‚Äù
He walked over to the counter. ‚ÄúHave I got any mail?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see ... that‚Äôs...?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúHolton.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>The clerk looked, then shook his head. ‚ÄúNo mail, Mr Holton.‚Äù
He paused. ‚ÄúYou was in the army?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, I was in the army.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSo was I.‚Äù The clerk was lonely and wanted to talk and
Holton was still tired and nervous and wanted to think. ‚ÄúIt
sure is nice being out,‚Äù said the clerk.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs good to be out.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI was with the 82nd; you remember the 82nd, don‚Äôt
you?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúOf course I do.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe had a good group of guys.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI know you did.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNothing like being a civilian, is there?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Robert Holton, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing like being out.
Good night.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood night.‚Äù The clerk who had been with the army was
sad to see him go.</p>

<p>He turned the light on in his room. It was all just the
same, the troubling painting and the crowded dresser. Sometimes
he would come into his room and have a feeling that
everything would be changed when he turned on the light,
that something exciting would have happened to change his
room. It was always the same, though; always the way he
left it.</p>

<p>Holton went into the bathroom. He should take a bath;
he wanted to take a bath but he was too tired. In the morning;
there would be time for that in the morning.</p>

<p>He undressed and put on the bottom of his pajamas; he
never used the tops. Then he looked at himself in the mirror
for a long time. He did not see himself in the mirror; he saw
no image; rather he was trying to find an image, an explanation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
in the glass. But he found nothing and as he realized his
failure the reflection of his face appeared in the mirror and
he looked at it without interest because it was familiar and
because he could see nothing behind it.</p>

<p>He turned and went into his room. He sat down on the
bed and wondered whether he could sleep or not because
his mind was uneasy. Holton turned out the lights and
stretched out on his bed. He would make himself sleep; he
would not think of Carla or of the day ended.</p>

<p>But his mind was too active now for him to sleep. He tried
to hypnotize himself, tried not to hear the odd words and
conversations in his ears.</p>

<p>He gave up finally. The barriers went down.</p>

<p>George <em>Robert</em> Lewis‚Äôs voice sounded in his head and the
clashing colors of the fairy night club glittered in his head.
Lewis‚Äôs voice, flat and nasal, became articulate.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI do feel that religion is merely a substitute for the loss
of a personal vision.‚Äù His sharp little laugh sounded and
the words repeated themselves over and over again in Robert
Holton‚Äôs ear: loss of a personal vision ... a vision ...
and elision.... The words became a refrain. The repetitions
went on until Holton felt himself losing control. He
was angry. He made the repetitions stop.</p>

<p>George <em>Robert</em> Lewis began to talk again.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI feel that we can find some way through the morass of
life, some way to be serene and not sterile, not static. I think
probably art is the way for the sensitive. If one has talent
one can practise a medium; without talent one can appreciate.</p>

<p>‚ÄúLove? What <em>does</em> that word mean, darling? I‚Äôve tried so
awfully hard to be sincere about it and I‚Äôve had some delicious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
attempts at it. Did you ever know Philip?... No, of
course you wouldn‚Äôt have known. But as I was saying ...
what was I saying?‚Äù</p>

<p>Holton tried consciously to recall what Lewis had said.
But when he tried to hear speeches again he could not.
Lewis‚Äôs voice began again, a disembodied voice speaking
among colors in a place where all emotions were in a minor
key.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think one must really barricade oneself against the
world. One must retreat. Now don‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs cowardly to
retreat. Nothing in this world should be put on such a superficial
basis as that. We are talking on different planes. That‚Äôs
why communication is so difficult. Every argument is true
and false and can be argued rightly from either side. To
have any agreement those discussing should decide right
away on what plane they want to talk. On a superficial and
obvious one the terms bravery and cowardice and right and
wrong have a certain meaning. On a deeper plane they have
different, sometimes opposite, meanings&mdash;sometimes no
meaning at all.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, to get back to my point, on the <em>deepest</em> level of understanding
only instinct and what is natural counts. If one
can‚Äôt arrive at love (and so many of us, darling, haven‚Äôt the
capacity for it) then one must make a substitute, something
to take up the sixty or seventy years one is alive. That‚Äôs
where art is important. I understand business men feel the
same way about business, though I‚Äôm not at all sure about
that.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd then as for all this driveling about going to Rome
let me say I do feel that religion is merely a substitute for
the loss of a personal vision....‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>The sound of Lewis‚Äôs voice became louder and continued
until finally the voice became so loud that it ceased to be a
voice and became silence.</p>

<p>Robert Holton wanted to sleep but there were so many
things that had to be arranged first.</p>

<p>There was also the dream of the night before to be recalled.
He would think of that later.</p>

<p>He remembered Jim Trebling. He thought of the days on
the boat when they had talked about the future.</p>

<p>Against a background of sea he could recall the image of
Trebling. Details were absent and he could not make out
the face but he could hear the voice and he could see the
ocean.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI hate the idea of being tied down any more than I have
to be. You know, Bob, we‚Äôve lived the most unnatural life
there is during this war. I get the feeling sometimes that
we‚Äôve lost a lot of time. I keep wanting to start over again.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI might want to start my own business. I think that‚Äôs not
so bad: it‚Äôs worse working for somebody else. It‚Äôs funny but
I‚Äôd just as soon never work. I‚Äôd just as soon drift the rest
of my life.‚Äù</p>

<p>And Robert Holton had agreed. He agreed in those days.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOf course you have to have money to loaf. Maybe if we
hadn‚Äôt been raised in such a sound middle-class way we
could be bums but we‚Äôre too used to being comfortable. No,
we‚Äôre too used to being comfortable. We‚Äôve got to get the
money first.‚Äù</p>

<p>Robert Holton had agreed to that, too. He had agreed to
everything. He wanted to be as free as possible. At least he
thought he had then. Because his friend wanted it he felt he
did too. He assumed a similar identity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>Trebling had more to say and his deep laughing voice
continued: ‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôre going to have to work a little. Not
much, just a little to get enough ahead. We‚Äôre going to be
careful though not to get bogged down, not to get too interested
in working. It‚Äôs dangerous to get to like it.‚Äù</p>

<p>Holton agreed.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, Bob, get your mind on the ball. How‚Äôre we going
to spend that army money? I think pottery out in California
sounds easy.‚Äù</p>

<p>Yes, pottery was easy. Then they separated and they
changed. Or perhaps only he, Holton, had changed. He‚Äôd
done the easiest thing, he thought. But it was true that he
was entangled now for the rest of his life with Heywood
and Golden; with them or another like them.</p>

<p>Trebling was entangled, too. Holton was pleased by that
as he lay in the dark. Trebling hadn‚Äôt done better. He belonged
to the army now and his chances of beginning a business
were slight. He might try it though; he might be able
to live the way he wanted to. Holton shuddered. It would
be awful to miss freedom so narrowly.</p>

<p>There was a problem, still unsolved: what did he want?</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù said Trebling‚Äôs voice, rising up out of the
sea, ‚Äúyou know you make things tough for yourself. You
don‚Äôt make up your mind.‚Äù</p>

<p>That wasn‚Äôt true, he was always plotting; most of the
time, anyway.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou try to be like everybody else.‚Äù</p>

<p>He was safest when he was like the rest of them. No, that
wasn‚Äôt a bad thing to do; besides, he wasn‚Äôt that way really.
He was different from the others in the office. They sensed
that. He would probably go a long way and most of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
wouldn‚Äôt. Perhaps he was like Heywood. That wasn‚Äôt bad.
Heywood was a success. <em>He</em> could be free if he liked. He had
money and he could do whatever he liked.</p>

<p>Trebling‚Äôs voice was fainter now and the sound of the sea
behind it was becoming loud. ‚ÄúSure we might flop but if
we don‚Äôt we‚Äôre just fine. I‚Äôm not worried; I‚Äôm not worried
about anything except being stuck in an office and working
for somebody. That‚Äôs a lot to worry about, I suppose, but
I‚Äôm not bothered. It‚Äôs going to work out. You‚Äôre a long time
dead, I figure ...‚Äù</p>

<p>The sea came into Holton‚Äôs room then and he was whirled
on the top of a wave; for a moment there was nothing but
sensation. He opened his eyes in the dark and the sea was
gone.</p>

<p>Trebling‚Äôs voice was lost.</p>

<p>Holton turned over on his side, troubled, tired, looking for
sleep. He thought of Carla. He had to think of her; there
was a decision to be made.</p>

<p>She had been quiet when he left her in the apartment.
She had not looked him in the eyes and he had been eager
to leave, to escape.</p>

<p>Now she began to speak again. She had talked to him as
he was dressing.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it would work now. I‚Äôd hoped it would; for
a long time I‚Äôve thought about you, about our living together.
But you don‚Äôt want to.‚Äù</p>

<p>He had tried to deny this but he could not deny what he
felt.</p>

<p>Her voice came back to him now, a sad thin echo; there
was no vibrancy in the remembered voice. She was whispering
in an empty room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to accept a pattern and I can‚Äôt stop you. I
can‚Äôt bring out the capacity for love in you. You have it, I
know, but I‚Äôm not enough to make you aware....‚Äù</p>

<p>Again the denial and again the sad voice whispering.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo, I was wrong to try to change your life. It‚Äôs very
selfish to do things for people they don‚Äôt want done. I
wanted you so much. You‚Äôre the one I‚Äôm not supposed to
have, though, and that‚Äôs sad for me.‚Äù</p>

<p>He had talked to her then and explained that he could not
take the risk of living with her, that he must be within the
pattern. But he could not make any of these things sound
convincing. Somehow everything got confused as he tried
to explain himself to her. He tried to tell her that he did
love her but that he couldn‚Äôt live with her. She had listened
and when he had finished she had talked again. Now her
voice entered his room; it was a shadow‚Äôs voice murmuring
in his ear.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd better see you again, Bob. It‚Äôs very hard
for me but I‚Äôm going to control myself. I am going to forget
all the things I had dreamed about since Florence. I shall
find a new object and that‚Äôs a hard thing to do. It‚Äôs hard to
change but I will.‚Äù</p>

<p>That was true, of course. There was also more.</p>

<p>She walked with him to the door; she let him go free to
his chosen prison.</p>

<p>The little voice no longer whispered in his ear and there
was nothing but silence and the beating of his heart, the
slow beating of his heart.</p>

<p>The shade of the window fluttered in the outside wind.
Bits of light gleamed around the shade as it fluttered. Lights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
from signs and behind those lights, gray and massive, was
the light of early morning. The room grew colder.</p>

<p>He got under the blanket and he closed his eyes tight and
thought of nothing: thought of shapes and shadows and
lights and colors and all the things that comprise nothing:
he could not sleep.</p>

<p>Robert Holton made a case for himself as he lay in the
occasionally broken dark.</p>

<p>He had no gift. He was an average person. Perhaps not
quite average, he had had many advantages. He was among
the many, though. He could not make a world separate. He
wished now that he had told Carla that: he could not make
a world separate. He belonged to the world of all people
and it was wrong to retreat from that world. He felt noble
as he thought of this: it was an excellent argument and he
wished that he had used it.</p>

<p>To have gone to live with Carla would have been a retreat
from all that was right. Right? What had Lewis said about
the planes of understanding? It didn‚Äôt matter because Lewis
was just another little fairy. He was perverted in everything.
No, it was right not to live with Carla. He had to do what
was expected of him.</p>

<p>Robert Holton built himself an argument, and as he built
his barricades stronger he was aware of discontent, well-hidden
beyond the barricade but still alive. Duty was important
and difficult. Nothing that was right was easy. Was
that true? He was becoming confused.</p>

<p>He had worn too many faces. He thought of the myriad
faces he had been made to wear. He had been different with
every person he‚Äôd ever known. This lack of consistency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
bothered him. In the army he had been without care, without
ambition; he had been like Trebling.</p>

<p>With the people in the office he had been cold or warm,
as they were. He had given them what they expected. He
had been an actor with too many r√¥les to play. Tonight he
had played all of them for Carla and then he had become
lost and he had tried to be himself and he found that he
was not enough.</p>

<p>Every person saw him differently, not entirely because
every person was different, but because he had also intended
it to be that way. Now he did not know himself. He had no
way of knowing the person behind the myriad faces.</p>

<p>For a moment he felt himself sinking. It was like a dream
of falling. He seemed to be descending into a pit without
bottom. There was no longer a Robert Holton: only a series
of masks, cracked now and no longer usable, no longer convincing.
He could never use one again.</p>

<p>He stopped falling; by an effort of will he stopped himself.
Carla was gone and he was sorry. There was no one
else and loneliness now crept out of the silence. He would
have to build the barricades stronger and higher. He would
shut loneliness out.</p>

<p>The masks were no longer good. Carla had helped him
break them. This was to be a beginning then. He would
assume an identity. He would become a decided person and
he would cease to be changed by others.</p>

<p>Robert Holton would become a successful broker working
in an office.</p>

<p>The decision was made and he felt secure at last. The
words and thoughts that had been in his mind, troubling
him, stopped abruptly. He had a magic of his own and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
had used it and it worked. Now he was free. There would
be no more talk of going away to Florence and living with
a pretty woman who loved him and wanted him to be different.
He was resolved at last. It was as simple as that.
With great effort he assumed an identity and freed himself
from doubt.</p>

<p>He stopped twisting. The fever was leaving and he was
tired.</p>

<p>Robert Holton turned over on his stomach and took a
deep breath. Soon he would be asleep. All his questions
were solved&mdash;except one. There was still something to be
taken care of, something not very important, but bothersome.
He frowned with his eyes shut. Then he opened them
and he looked across the room at the dark outline of the
picture frame.</p>

<p>The dream.</p>

<p>He hadn‚Äôt been able to remember the dream of the night
before: the troubling, unpleasant dream. It had great significance,
he knew.</p>

<p>His only half-conscious mind tried to remember. He kept
it purposefully unawake because in this state, between sensation
and memory, most dreams could be recalled.</p>

<p>For a long time he wondered. But he could not remember,
and he went to sleep finally, exhausted, and in his mind
was hidden the dream of the night before, the secret dream,
the dream of death, of living. He had almost remembered.</p>

</div>


<p class="p2">The next day was cold, colder than the early morning
had been.</p>

<p>Robert Holton took a bath, dressed, and went down in the
elevator. He said good morning to the man at the desk who
gave him a letter from his father. Then he went outside;
shivering, he walked to the subway station. Without buying
a paper he went down into the ground and at Wall Street
he came to the surface again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Marjorie Ventusa was glad to see him. The movie she had
seen the night before had been a successful tragedy and she
had wept and had been able to think about herself less
tragically afterward.</p>

<p>She watched him as he came into the restaurant. He went
to his usual table and sat down. After he was seated she
picked up a tray and walked over to him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood morning, Mr Holton,‚Äù she said, and smiled.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHello, Marjorie. How‚Äôs everything going?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúFine, just fine. Weather‚Äôs getting cold, though.‚Äù She noticed
that he had dark circles under his eyes. She tried not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
to think of what he might have been doing with the dark-haired
girl.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGot anything good for breakfast? I feel pretty worn out
today.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI guess you were out late last night.‚Äù</p>

<p>He nodded. She couldn‚Äôt stop asking now; she couldn‚Äôt
stop thinking about Robert Holton and the dark-haired girl.</p>

<p>‚ÄúProbably one of those big parties, I guess.‚Äù</p>

<p>He nodded and said, ‚ÄúSure, one of those big parties.‚Äù</p>

<p>She was not sorry that he lied. ‚ÄúWe got some good sausage
today,‚Äù she said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôll take whatever you got ... and black coffee.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôll go get it.‚Äù She walked back to the kitchen. She
frowned when she saw Mrs Merrin looking at her. She had
to look serious even though she was happy. He had at least
not wanted to tell her that he was out with another girl.
She had made so many images of Holton and herself that
she accepted an imagined closeness as real. He had not
really been unfaithful this time.</p>

<p>She called out his order to the cook and then she fixed her
snood in the steamy mirror. She had bought a dark snood
and she noticed now that it made her hair look darker, look
rather mysterious. It felt good to look mysterious.</p>

<p>His breakfast was ready and she took it out to him.</p>

<p>She made herself busy at the next table and she talked to
him as she worked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou like going out to them big parties?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúNot so much.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhy do you go?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBusiness, I guess. It‚Äôs good to see all the big shots.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right there; you‚Äôre sure right there.‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that you got on your head?‚Äù</p>

<p>She giggled self-consciously and wished that she didn‚Äôt
get so silly when she was pleased. ‚ÄúJust a snood. I‚Äôve had it
such a long time.‚Äù This was not true.</p>

<p>‚ÄúLooks nice,‚Äù said Holton seriously, biting into a piece of
bread.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThank you; I like it.‚Äù No, that was wrong, it sounded defiant
and she didn‚Äôt mean that. She added in a much softer
voice, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you like it.‚Äù</p>

<p>He ate then and she put dirty dishes on her tray. Then he
said, ‚ÄúWhen‚Äôre you going to Italy with me?‚Äù</p>

<p>She laughed. ‚ÄúI got some previous engagements before.
Any other time, though.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm told it‚Äôs nice there,‚Äù said Holton and she noticed that
he looked sad and she was happy to think that he was a
little concerned about her, that he was almost serious when
he talked about Italy.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôll go some other time,‚Äù she said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSure,‚Äù said Holton, ‚Äúmaybe we‚Äôll go some other time.‚Äù
He drank his coffee. He looked at his watch. ‚ÄúLord, I‚Äôm
late,‚Äù he said. He paid her quickly. ‚ÄúSee you at lunch.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúSee you at lunch, Mr Holton.‚Äù She watched him go out
the door and into the crowded street.</p>

<p>She cleared his table. Then she went gaily back to the
kitchen, her hair bobbing mysteriously in its snood. She was
glad she hadn‚Äôt told him she‚Äôd seen him in Times Square.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‚ÄúLate, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù asked Caroline when Holton came into
the office. She knew he was late but she was in a mood of
violent humor; she was always this way when she was happy
and she was happy today because of Trebling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúNot very,‚Äù said Holton and he went to his desk. Mr
Murphy hadn‚Äôt come in yet and he was safe. Caroline sat for
a moment enjoying the pale white sunlight that shone across
her desk. Then she got up and came over to Holton‚Äôs desk.</p>

<p>She was awkward now. She wanted to find out things but
she didn‚Äôt want to be subtle. She tried anyway. ‚ÄúI was out
with Jim last night,‚Äù she began.</p>

<p>‚ÄúHow do you like him?‚Äù Holton wasn‚Äôt paying much attention
to her and this was irritating. He was busy putting
books on his desk. She looked around to see if anyone was
watching. Kuppelton was out of the room and no one else
appeared interested. She sat down on his desk.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI like him quite a bit,‚Äù she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her. ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJim‚Äôs a fine fellow.
You‚Äôll have fun playing around with him.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI suppose I will.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt take him too seriously, though. He‚Äôs sort of an
expert with girls.‚Äù How shallow Holton was, thought Caroline.
‚ÄúJust play with him and you‚Äôll be all right. A lot of
girls‚Äôve liked him.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúI can understand that. He‚Äôs really serious about starting
something himself. At least he doesn‚Äôt want to work for
somebody like everybody else wants.‚Äù She wanted this to be
sharp; she didn‚Äôt care if it hurt or not.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good thing to want,‚Äù said Holton. How dull he
is, thought Caroline, comparing him unfavorably with Jim
Trebling.</p>

<p>There was nothing she wanted to know from Holton.
‚ÄúHow was your society party?‚Äù she asked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt was O.K.,‚Äù said Holton. ‚ÄúIt was interesting.‚Äù</p>

<p>I‚Äôll bet, thought Caroline. She was impatient of others now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
that she knew she was appreciated, knew that she was to
see Trebling that night. ‚ÄúWell, don‚Äôt work too hard,‚Äù said
Caroline, getting up from the desk. ‚ÄúBy the way, I‚Äôm going
out with Jim tonight.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBetter be careful,‚Äù said Holton seriously.</p>

<p>She laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always careful; didn‚Äôt you know that?‚Äù</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Heywood was feeling well. He had managed to get home
early the night before. That was one advantage in going to
the theater alone: you didn‚Äôt have to go some place afterward
and get drunk.</p>

<p>He sat contentedly in the mahogany twilight of his large
office, looking at a photograph of himself. There was no particular
work to be done. Golden hadn‚Äôt bothered him yet
and it would be almost an hour before he had his first conference.</p>

<p>A buzz came out of the box on his desk. He pressed a
button.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMr Murphy to see you,‚Äù said his secretary, concealed in
the box.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSend him in.‚Äù There was something he had to tell
Murphy. Something to do with the party. The young man,
Robert Holton: he was to do something for him.</p>

<p>‚ÄúGood morning, Murphy.‚Äù Mr Heywood did not bother
to rise.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMorning, Mr Heywood,‚Äù said Murphy and Heywood
wished his voice wasn‚Äôt so loud. It jarred the twilight mood
of the office.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve got some statistics here, the ones on Steel stocks; the
ones showing fluctuation and ...‚Äù</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>‚ÄúAh, yes, Murphy, that‚Äôs very good of you to have them
for me so promptly. I have another matter to discuss....‚Äù
Heywood paused to make sure that Murphy was listening to
him carefully. ‚ÄúThis boy, Holton,‚Äù he went on, ‚ÄúI think he
might do better dealing with the public, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Murphy judiciously, ‚Äúyes, I think that might
be a good place for him. You saw him last night?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat? Oh, yes, I saw him last night. I had a pleasant
talk with him. He‚Äôs a clever young man, I think.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYes, he‚Äôs got a good head on his shoulders,‚Äù agreed
Murphy.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou will tell him, won‚Äôt you, about his promotion and,
ah, transfer?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúCertainly. He‚Äôll be glad to hear this. I‚Äôll be glad to tell
him. And, by the way, there‚Äôs another matter in my section....‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd what is that?‚Äù asked Heywood gently, trying not to
yawn.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôve a man named Kuppelton who‚Äôs always done
a good job and I think he should get the usual promotion in
that department. The one we had in mind for Holton.‚Äù</p>

<p>Heywood sighed. ‚ÄúCertainly, Murphy; I rely, as always,
on your recommendation in these cases.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúThank you....‚Äù They talked then of nothing that interested
Mr Heywood. Finally Murphy left.</p>

<p>Mr Heywood yawned and stretched. He was rested and
almost happy. He would make good decisions today. He sat
back in his chair and looked at the photograph of himself.
He would divorce his wife and go to South America for a
year. Or perhaps he wouldn‚Äôt divorce his wife but take her
to South America instead. It was strange but he looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
younger now than he did when the photograph was taken
several years before.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Kuppelton heard the news his first impulse was to
call his mother immediately on the phone and tell her all
about it. He decided not to, though, because, after all, it
wasn‚Äôt completely official. He did talk to Holton about it.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCongratulations,‚Äù he said as he came over to Holton‚Äôs
desk. Mr Murphy had already gone to lunch and it was safe
to talk.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù said Holton, smiling. He didn‚Äôt seem as happy
as Kuppelton expected him to be.</p>

<p>‚ÄúCaroline just told me that Mr Murphy told you you were
going to be a customers‚Äô man and I‚Äôm certainly glad to see
you‚Äôre getting ahead. I always thought that this job would
be too small to hold you.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúWhen do you think
you‚Äôll move out?‚Äù he asked, looking away.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe first of next week probably.‚Äù Holton chuckled. ‚ÄúI
guess you‚Äôll be sorry to see me leave.‚Äù</p>

<p>Kuppelton recognized the sarcasm but he didn‚Äôt care.
‚ÄúSure I‚Äôm sorry. Of course, it‚Äôs good news, in a way, for me.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt is at that.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou sure got a good deal. Well, you can‚Äôt beat City Hall
I always say.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou always say that?‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat? Well, no, but.... What I meant was....‚Äù</p>

<p>Robert Holton only laughed.</p>

<p>Kuppelton tried to talk some more with him but it was
very difficult; they never had liked each other, anyway.
Kuppelton left him to go to lunch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>He was jubilant but dignified as he put on his coat and
hat and walked down the corridor. He would have a lot of
news to tell his mother tonight. Everything had worked out
nicely and soon he would be making more money and everyone
he knew was happy.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
